-4	 worse place ever eaten,,cold food,,dirty looking staff,landlord big headed,and you better not complain about anything,, and the worse john smiths iv ever tasted at top price too. decor way out of date,,A PUB ON ITS LAST LEGS.searching for scraps,,dont be one 
-4	 Went last Friday with a friend with the intention to dine, however after the excessive unpleasant attitude and rudeness from one of the waitresses, completely unwarranted, we walked out before ordering after notifying the Manageress who apologised and recommended we eat in the bar instead as we refused to stay in the restaurant.. The bar staff on the otherhand were really helpful and friendly before we entered the restaurant and after. However after drinks, due in part to the previous experence we went elsewhere to eat. 
-4	 My husband and I ordered a delivery at 6:45 arrived at 8pm without my meal.  I called immediately and told them my food was missing.  The gentleman told my husband that the driver had a few more deliveries and would then go back to collect and deliver.  I took over the call and said that wasn't good enough and we ordered our meal together as we wanted to eat together.  The man on the phone didn't care so I insisted on speaking to the manager he was full of excuses and in ordinary circumstances I'd accept that however... This is not the first time, granted it's been over a year but once delivery was almost 2hrs and prior to this they forgot my food. Against my better judgment we ordered again from here.  After a chat with the manager he agreed to deliver by 8:15pm (my bad I should have specified I wanted it today!)  As a &quot;goodwill gesture&quot; the manager is sending a bottle of coke (that I dont drink),  I don't advise going to this take away!! 
-4	 When a chef won't eat in her own restaurant what does that say?  Our visit on 6th December was a disaster. When we arrived they told us there might be a delay as everyone was booked in for the same time!  I ordered sparkling water to drink. It was from a large bottle as they had no small bottles. It had been open for about a week I think as the sparkle had certainly left. I ordered a curry and again was warned there would be a wait. There was indeed, we waited 1 hour 45 minutes and when it came it was inedible. The sauce was like water and so spiced it had no flavour just heat. We were told they had had a run on curry so the chef had made some more and that was why it was so tasteless. Another customer had been told that the chef doesn't eat curry so she didn't know how much spice to use! We were not charged for this curry and the bar staff were very nice. I don't know how they could stay so cheerful in the circumstances.  The place was freezing and very dingy. Desperately in need of some tlc. Will definitely never visit this place again. 
-4	 We visited here for a business networking event. There were approximately 25 of us who booked 2 weeks in advance.  The restaurant wished to provide us with a set menu to simplify the orders, this was no issue until it came to the delivery of the service.  We were booked for 7:45, we were quickly seated, however we were split over two tables. Not an issue in itself, however the staff decided to treat the two tables as two different parties and refused to deal with the second table until they had served the first.  It took 50 mins for them to take a drinks order and provide 1 poddadum to each attendee. It was over and hour and a half before we got a main course, even then it took a long time for all dishes to be served and the curry had gone cold before they served rice.  Trying to order a drink was a joke.   Many of us complained to the staff, but they were completely indifferent. If this hadn't have been a business meeting then I would have walked out.  The food was nice, but the service was so bad I would never go back here or tell anyone else to try it. 
-4	First time going there for a meal. what a disappointing meal this was.  They don't even bring any cutlery sauces etc over to you, we had to go over ourselves. Get better service at a bloody Hungry Horse.  We ordered a starter- which we didnt even get  Our mains came out first - we both ordered a burger, which was passable untill i noticed the horrific bacon that was just slapped onto the top... the bacon was disgusting, i wouldnt of even fed this to my dog. It was cold, uncooked, and fat was all over it.  I bet they wouldnt eat it themsevles so why should i eat it? It was very expensive meal for what we got and i was very very disappointed. I eat out quite regulary and ive had better service, and food at cheaper places. I did let the staff know i wasnt happy with the bacon and he seemed very uninterested... if this was me, due to working in a customer service environment id be making sure the customer got an apology for the meal. Nothing was said and he took our dishes from us when he bought the dessert out. So we where sat outside for ages with our old dishes .. Poor poor poor service. I had to ask for them to take off the starter from my bill because we hadnt even received it.  It still came to about 50.00... i thought it was a total ripoff.  I had sent them an email of complaint this morning but havent heard back so this is why i am writing on here because maybe they will take me a bit more seriously.
-4	 went to eat here today after reading the 'all year round' sign. Actually they are closed for the next month! 
-4	 This was the fourth time we had eaten here, the previous 3 were excellent but this one was poor at best. The waiter was lacking in every department and all the food tasted of nothing but chilli powder.  We got the impression that the place had been taken over by new management who were not really interested in providing a good dining experience. 
-4	 Arrived and had to.wait 15 minutes to be seated. We were asked if we were ready to order before we had even sat down! When food came, our daughters came out first but timber peas were still frozen. Me and my partner then had to.wait an additional half an hour for our food! My partner instantly sent his back as his steak was over cooked, peas were raw, onion rings were burnt and chips had been refried. My partner is a chef himself and after paying £20 for just his own meal and upgrades we expect perfect quality. When we complained to a manager, she shrugged it off and said nothing.was wrong at all with the food and it was checked. She didn't even apologise and said we should be grateful they replaced the meal. Avoid like the chuffin plague. 
-4	 have been twice as part of a party - they pack you in. I went as part of a party thesecond time having been ill the first, and did not eat much, but threww up again 
-4	 Hadn't been here for some months and what a disappointment.  First of all wrong meals were delivered. Then, presumably as three meals had to be reissued, the other two meals were put under the hot light. This resulted in the sandwich being 'toasted' on the top, The cheese and bacon jacket was tasteless and dry - again presumably as it had to wait for the other three meals to arrive. These were then obviously rushed through as all jacket potatoes were almost raw.  Pleasant waiter who offered his apologies (which could only just be heard above the screaming of the children at a nearby table). 
-4	 Very poor experience celebrating my brother inlaws birthday the quality of food wasn't good and the way it was served didn't help just no attention paid. Although it was just a buffet the quality of food and service was dreadful. Certainly wouldn't ever go back there to eat again! 
-4	I could not believe this restaurant had so many good reviews. There is nothing authentic or Italian about this place. First, there were three of us. We asked to be seated at a table, but were squeezed into a booth for two despite the fact that the restaurant was empty. Presumably this was to make the place look full to passers by. Although our daughter's pasta dish was passable, the &quot;lamb in rosemary&quot; was almost inedible and consisted of fatty and gristly lamb steaks with bone in, badly flash fried so that what we asked for to be medium rare varied from raw to partially raw, and then smothered in a glutinous brown sauce which may or not have been gravy with a few pieces of dried rosemary arranged on the top. I was expecting a luscious Tuscan-type stew, bursting with flavours of rosemary and garlic. What I got was revolting and at over £30 per head, I couldn't even excuse it for being cheap.
-4	a starter of crisps with a little bit of melted cheese on it. The menu said that it was with onions but I expected small pieces of potatoes. The pizza was supposed to have cheese edges it did have puffed up pizza but no cheese in it.A disgusting meal.
-4	 The service is horrible and moreover any of the &quot;acting&quot; managers have the worst customer experience ever! I was there with my sister and boyfriend and the food did not come up together and it was also wrong! The JIUCY burger was tough as old boots and when we point out that it was not a good service and poor food. After complaining we that we were offered a free round of drinks for a bill that was over £100, and told if we can't afford to eat in a VIP area we should go somewhere else, if I was you reading this I would head to Byron that is opening next door.....REPEAT NEVER EVER EAT HERE.... IT'S THE WORST PLACE I HAVE EATEN and I've been to some bad places... 
-4	 I have just got home from visiting this restaurant and have to say I am disgusted, I have never writen a review as soon as I come home but I must say this place is far to expensive for the bland tasting food but what has repulsed me the most that my partner witnessed, a table slightly behind me so I did not see what happened but the table were being served deserts and the waitress had a bowl of ice cream in her hand in which a fly had landed on, my partner said that she took a moment and clearly was thinking what to do but what she decided to do was to blow the fly away and served that same bowl of ice cream to the unsuspecting customer, unfortunately the staff do not wear name tags but she was about 20 years old, blonde with a tattoo of a bike on her back, this girl should not be in the food industry if she makes decisions like that, cos we all know that fly's wonder on turds. Oh and the floor in the restaurant was filthy. Would never go back. 
-4	 I went to the take away part of this place today and the only thing worse than the food was the service. I was served by a young lady who was abrupt and quite frankly looked like she should be on suicide watch. I appreciate that nobody wants to work new years day but there is no need for bad customer service. I only ordered chips and gravy and somehow they managed to stretch this out to a 5 minute wait. When I got my food home I discovered that the gravy was inedible. I could only describe it as looking like pond water. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on its taste as i had to pour it down the sink. It is safe to say that I will not be visiting again. 
-4	 The good bit - of course the views are great, the bar is lovely, great atmosphere and cocktails    The bad - probably the worst meal that I have ever eaten in a London restaurant - AVOID - stop in for a cocktail and head on to one of the many many many amazing restaurants in this city. This is a restaurant where they know they will be fully booked due to location and it feels like they have made no effort with the food ... 
-4	 Went for lunch with friends not all of us wanted a carvery but there isn't a great choice of anything else. I got a cheese sandwiche which was 3/4 pickle 1/4 dried up cheese on stale bread with a few roast potatoes thrown on the plate. Roast potatoes why??? Put chips or salad but roast potatoes? It's not my first visit I keep giving it a chance but it is my last. It needs to improve the food choice and quality and have a deep clean pronto! 
-4	 I visited this restaurant this evening at about 7.30 there where 5 of us , as we entered staff where friendly and we was seated quickly .once seated we all got up to get our food to be fair there was a good variety so we all tucked in !!! One of our party went up for seconds and on her plate she had steamed vegetables which contained broccoli after tucking in she said what is this is this a MAGGOT !!!! I had a look it wasn't one there was loads of them the broccoli was full of them !!!! The manager came over and his reply to this was sorry I will take one meal off !!!! He did t look surprised or phased at all !!!!!! I wouldn't allow him to take the plate , he then proceeded to storm off to get my refund ! As a employ of a restaurant chain I'm absolutely disgusted and will be passing on all photos to the local authorities in the morning !!! Do not eat here this is diabolical for a restaurant to say the least !!!!! 
-4	Booked room for New Years eve . With a dinner and dance . Rang to say that my booking was no longer available had email confirmation. Whilst I was upset the way the co-owner of the hotel spoke to me made matters worse blaming booking.com which they kindly sent me proof they were not at fault. Decided to cancel the whole lot with the treatment I received.
-4	 We had stayed previously but not had dinner. The breakfast was great and on that basis, and a look at the dinner menu, we decided to invite friends on our next visit to Stroud. This is a very interesting converted old convent which puts on intimate jazz and folk concerts on many evenings and there was a concert starting at 9pm on the evening we booked. We were the second party to arrive at 7pm and from then on it was downhill all the way. When ordering the waiter told us that one item was no longer on the menu (instead of telling us when he gave us the menus). The wine list is odd with prices bearing no relationship to the quality of the wine. We chose a Gewurtstraminer and a Bordeaux 2009 Cru Bourgeois. After an hour and a half during which time the restaurant filled up with concert goers, and we ploughed through the Gewurtstraminer, the starters arrived. They were paltry (5 prawns on a tablespoon of tomato concasse with a small amount of feta, one spray of roasted broccoli which was hard and charred with a sprinkling of nuts, goujons of lamb (actually two small croquettes tasting vaguely of leftover roasted lamb), bean and chickpea soup which was lukewarm beans in tomato something) and all amazingly expensive for what they were (£8-£9.50). After another delay (by which time the restaurant had mostly emptied) the mains arrived and we poured out the Bordeaux which we had not been invited to taste. Describing the mains would only remind me of an experience which I would prefer to forget. Suffice it to say that this chef MUST BE ON AN INCREDIBLY TIGHT BUDGET. Only then did we notice that the Bordeaux was a 2011 rather than the generally much more expensive 2009 which we had ordered. We decided against desserts, coffee etc. As we left, smarting from the exorbitant bill, the waiter apologised for the delay saying that the chef decided to deal with the concert goers first so that they could get out in time. And as we had sat there watching our fellow diners we thought their pizzas and burgers looked pretty good. But this is not a place to dine out. 
-4	Had the misfortune of visiting Whitmore Tearooms twice recently (I had to attend on the second occasion as a guest of a friend). On both occasions, the service was genuinely abysmal; having to wait endlessly for our food. Furthermore, the waitress did her best to avoid our table and eye-contact, and only chased the missing dishes (only an English breakfast and an omelette) after an hour. This was especially irritating as there were more staff than customers! The food is also rather overpriced and our drinks were cold by the time the food came. No apologies or offers of a fresh cup of tea. Another example of customers being taken for granted. Won't be returning.
-4	We visited with our 2 children (13 and 8) on a family trip to London.  On entering we were taken downstairs to a small, dark area of the restaurant even though there was plenty of room upstairs in natural daylight! The menu was disappointing and the food when it arrived was mediocre at best. At the risk of sounding old, the music was loud and we seemed to be seated in an area where the staff gathered to chat! We sat in silence while we ate, unable to hear each other speak anyway! We did visit on a Monday (Monday Madness) during a promotion where there is up to 50% off the menu prices which did represent good value for some dishes. My husbands chicken salad was greasy and my vegi-burger could have been bought from Iceland! On a positive note, our children did enjoy their meals but we wouldn't consider visiting again and certainly would not recommend the experience! Try somewhere else in Covent Garden!
-4	 We booked (days in advance) for 10 people on Sunday 9th September. I had been told wonderful things about the pizzas at this restaurant so I was really looking forward to the meal.  We were allocated a waitress whom spoke/understood very little English.... I didn't realise this initially. I had asked CLEARLY if they would do me a starter size portion of their goat's cheese salad, the waitress went and asked the kitchen and agreed this would be fine. I also ordered a pizza for my main.   When the starters came out the salad was huge.. I asked the waitress if this was definitely a 'starter portion' with which she confirmed again that it was. Still not convinced I mentioned this to the (arrogant) manager as he was helping the waitress. He very rudely said it wasn't a starter and grabbed the dish back from under my nose, asking me to order Something else. He also accused me of not making myself clear enough to the waitress.   About 8 starters arrived but 2 of the party had to chase their food repeatedly. when they finally arrived one of the dishes was incorrect.. Again! And with this came yet another RUDE accusation from the waitress that he &quot;didn't order the tomato garlic bread, just a garlic bread&quot;.   With this the waitress and the manager avoided our table leaving it in a mess, but luckily another waitress noticed and politely cleared up where her awful colleagues had left off.   The pizzas seemed to take forever to arrive, I think we all just wanted to get out of there.... The food was good but sadly the manager (swanning around) and that incompetent waitress really let down the kitchen!  With the bill came a hefty service charge... We of course asked (politely) of they would remove this. Again the rude waitress remarked (like a stroppy teenager) &quot;we don't get the money anyway&quot;.... Once again unnecessary attitude.  Literally the worst restaurant I have ever been to... Absolutely no customer service, why these people are in hospitality I do not know! But they have lost 10 customers who will be sure to tell everyone they meet what a poor restaurant this is.  Zero Dregrees head office you need to micro manage this branch! 
-4	 I took my family for a meal to the chestnut tree on Saturday lunchtime on walking in the pub it smelt very badley of cigarette smoke I was very shocked by this as it's meant to be a smoke free inviroment ???. I have a small child with a chest condition which is affected by smoke. I asked one of the waiting staff why this was she replyed they smoke in the pub before opening and after close so the smell could be from that !!! How bad is this I will not be using this pub again and will also be telling other people about the expereance I had. 
-4	 Went here on a Friday night for a little drink before town with a friend and really wish I never first of all had to wait at least 20 minutes at the bar whilst the bar lady served everyone else before us even people who came after us, she poured out drinks that we asked for and slammed them down on the bar in front of us and without looking at me snapped at my friend 'does she have ID!' So I replied yes I do and got it out before I could even hand it over it was snatched out of my hand and then thrown back onto the wet beer soaked bar, I certainly will not be coming back in a hurry after the way she spoke to me with such a disgusting attitude and the awful looks I received every two seconds- so disappointed I used to love popping into the high field aswell 
-4	 I rang a few weeks ago to book a table for lunch and was told by the chap on the phone I wouldn't need to book for lunch as they always have tables free (not a promising start) I turned up today to find decorations for paddys day in the windows and a sign saying theyre closed for refurbishment (?) nobody seems to be answering the phone- very disappointing to drive all the way out from chester for nothing. 
-4	 I visited friends in Lichfield and they mentioned we could go to their local gatsropub. From their previous experiences I was really looking forward to our visit to the restaurant and even booked a table to avoid dissappointment. The service was awful incompetent and slow, I asked a few questions about the menu items and the staff knew little. The food was a mixture one dining partner had acceptable starter and main being deep fried brie starter and fish and chips. Another friend had an adequate squid starter (but was overpriced at £7) and ribs as a main. I had the scallop, black pudding and bacon starter it was £7 and about £3 overpriced given it was so tiny, I accept this starter is never going to be large but it was so tiny I thought it was a joke. We waited over 20 minutes between starter and main which was poor as the restaurant was quiet and my steak claimed to be a 10z rump. It was more 7oz but I could not be bothered to complain. The steak was awful it was overcooked and tough but the chips and mushrrom were very good, hoorah. Apparently the restaurant has changed hands and obviously for the worse maybe there are teething problems, but after spending £100 for four I will not be taking my chances 
-4	 I had a burger, and the bacon was rock solid it almost made me choke. The staff seemed harassed and pressured, i expected as it was an american diner to be relaxed but he seemed uptight and not genuinely friendly 
-4	 Sagar used to be brilliant. Good food, good delivery times. But... The last 2 times we've ordered from them they've estimated around 1 hr delivery, but last time it took 2.5 hrs and tonight it never arrived! We rang twice to chase it up after 2 hrs and were told: its on its way. Then : its definitely on its way, ring us if it doesn't arrive in 15 mins. Then they rang us and a very rude girl said they had sat outside our house for 15 minutes and we didn't answer!! They said we had a white door - wrong. So they got the wrong address maybe, but didn't phone us on the number they had at the time. Maybe they have changed hands, we will be avoiding them from now on. We have had to order a v late curry now from somewhere else as Sagar wasted our time. Why did they lie?? I'm so hungry! 
-4	Disgusting food not fit for human consumption. Dirty glasses. Dirty tables. Dirty cutlery. Dirty bathrooms.
-4	 Over priced. Dreadful service. Tiny portions. . No welcome. Cramped. Very disappointed. Can not recommend. Will never return. 
-4	 This was the second visit to the establishment and let's just say we r never going back! Wait to be seated, garlic bread in middle and looked anaemic, dry burger, non existent cheese on burger! Waitress sorted garlic bread! Yes refund was given but still unacceptable food! Thought we would go there instead of our normal establishment! Better the devil you know in future...... 
-4	Popped in the the kids for an old favourite. Has gone massively down hill and as expensive as posh fish chip restaurant in Hull. Batter was heavy and chips soggy. Will not go back again. Dissatisfie, anti-climax and disappointed.
-4	We wanted a bite to eat pre-theatre so left an hour and a half before the show started to have some food.  I'd looked before for a suitable restaurant but on Sundays it appears Wolverhampton town centre shuts! There seemed some nice Italian restaurants but none that were open, so we left it to luck to find something else.  Walking around for 15 minutes with no such luck, we saw a Nandos. I've never been in one but my son was keen to try. We were offered a table quick enough and sat to make our choice. I then went to queue, which took over 20 minutes....when I was very nearly about to give up, I reached the till only to be told the wait for food was 30 minutes!! I asked was it really 30 minutes, or would it be longer as we had a show to get to, and was told perhaps nearer to 40 minutes.   HOW FRUSTRATING, to queue this long only to then be told that there was an additional wait time. Why they couldn't tell people who had joined the back of the queue there was a long delay (an hour in total) I think was very poor customer service. ...we left pronto and could only find a Subway that just about fit the bill.  Disappointed with Wolverhampton ghost town eateries and very disappointed at this Nandos experience.
-4	sadly after being recommended Serendipidity by the local vicar in my area, both myself and my grandchild walked away utterly disappointed. Although the quality of food was very good, the staff, or should I say one particular member of staffl let the place down. I have since found out to my horror that it was the manager. I shall not be returning to Serendipidy unless they get a new manager that is, as i believe she really does let the place down. Perhaps I got her on a bad day, there really is no excuse however for bad manners.
-4	 We arrive at 8 with a group of 13! The starter arrived at 9pm and the music start at around 10pm... well if you can call it music. They did not give us a rest between courses and the music was rubbished. The foods was Ok but for the money you pay to go out the staff should make sure you have a good time. All of us was complaining how bad the night was so I took a stand and talk to the DJ to play some dancing music. He was so rude and said that i need to tell him as he has 30,000 collection of music. Throughout the night there were no encouragement from the staff or DJ to make sure customers had a good time. By 11pm some of the other customers left and we left at 11.30pm. I did complaint to the waiter that we did not have a good time and this was our night out. He said that they had a lot of cancellation today but on saturday usually is busy. I told him it is not our fault that other customers cancelled and it appears we have been punished for it. To charge £25 plus service charge and then to top it all get told off by the DJ!!! We did dance in the end and the DJ can see that we were trying to have a good time but the next song was so slow as if he wants all of us to leave the dance floor. I will complaint further as I have never experience a night out like this. TBH they can see no one had a good time but they still charge their service charge!! unbelievable! I think it is just about making money, selling as much alcohol as they can on the night! Perhaps this place is wonderful when all the tables are filled with customers but the staff should make sure that the customers that did not cancel enjoyed themselves. At the end of the day if you want your customers to return you should make sure they leave happy!. To top it all I had bad stomach all night... not sure if it is the food. 
-4	 We strolled by and thought the outside seating would be a nice place for lunch. What a mistake. We waited an awfully long time for our order to be taken and then another 25 minutes for our lunch to arrive. It wasn't even busy. I ordered the goats cheese and fig bruschetta and my husband ordered the Vietnamese Salad. His salad had 1 small piece of chicken for £12 and my bruschetta was so hard, I couldn't even cut it with a knife. We told the waitress we were not happy with the salad but she kept on walking and said she would be back. She never did come back. I finally went inside and told her we were leaving. Never going back. 
-4	Visited this establishment on a Saturday lunchtime .Well I have not had such bad customer service for a long time where to start oh yes on arrival we perused the menu purely light snacks and decided to order so made my way to the order till and was told no food till midday I looked at my watch it was 11.55 so duly asked can I pre order and we will wait to which the answer was No!.The chef will not allow it okay i thought it's five minutes I will try again at midday .So midday came in returned to the order point to be told someone will be with you in a moment which didn't happen until she returned so I went to order when I was told no food until 12.15.My patience was leaving me fast to which I said that's not what you told me a few minutes ago chef was not ready apparently. Honestly it's a cafe you serve food get your act together get your staff some customer service training they are rude .Also over heard a woman complaining about a hair in her mushrooms to which the same woman said where is your receipt we will give you a refund but can't give you a replacement meal chef said it seems to me your chef and I say that in the loosest terms is ruling the roost.Please if you value your sanity don't eat here.
-4	 Went out to lunch with a few girl friends - very disappointed the service was very slow at the bar, food took too long to arrive (friend had to go back to work as her lunch hour had ended). The burger I ordered was so over cooked and dry it could of been made from gandi's flip flop lol not good - pretty poor overall 
-4	 We ordered a burger and Fish and Chips in the pub. The burger was good, especially for the price, but the Fish and Chips were a nightmare. Not only did we have to wait for them for ages, but when we got it, it seemed that the Fish had spend the whole time we waited for it in hot fat. The fish was dark brown up to black on the outside and beyond dry on the inside. In addition it tasted like the fat it was fried in hadn't been changed for weeks. When we talked to the waitress about the problem, she offered a replacement. After waiting for 30 min for this replacement, we were about to leave and told the waitress so, at which point she miracously managed to give us a fish which seemed to have been kept under a warm lamp for quite some time. In total we waited for 60 minutes for our food and the second portion of Fish and Chips was still really bad. Not to recommend at all. 
-4	 I have eaten here once before which was an ok experience, this time it was shocking, the wait is a joke for basic pub food which in my mind is a little overpriced. The waiter had little clue of what he was doing ,no check back and whoever cooks the steaks needs to go on a refresh training course. we sent one meal back and by the time we received a replacement everyone else had finished. Great views from the window of the pond but that was the only positive, oh and wear a coat otherwise you may get hypothermia. 
-4	 Went here this evening, was stood at the bar waiting to be served and the barman serves the person directly behind me. When I challenged him as to why he did this we said &quot;that's my mate and if you keep talking like that you won't get served&quot;. So after he proceeded not to serve me I had to ask a friend to get my drink. I then told my boyfriend who took a picture of the barman intending to complain about him to management. Next thing I know the barman has asked the bouncers to throw us out. Luckily my partner knew the bouncer (who was brilliant at diffusing the situation) otherwise God knows what would have happened. I was made to delete the photos on my phone by the bar man (clearly a guilty conscience and didn't want to be identified). Have been coming here for 10+ years but won't be coming again. Worst customer service in Newquay, if you can't even manage to serve people in a fair and orderly manner then you shouldn't be a barman mate. 
-4	 We came with great excitement to newly opened Jamie's Italian in Tunbridge Wells. We had a guest from Croatia, where Jamie is very popular at present - we were looking forward to showing her a good, solid Italian eatery where the food is the most important ingredient.  The interior of the restaurant is modern and the atmosphere is very industrial and loud, but the tables are of good size and well apart. The wine was good, foccacia bread great.  However, the food was very disappointing. My lamb and mortadella contained mainly huge chunks or mortadella and three tiny pieces of lamb. It came on a bed of onions and parsley - no sauce - virtually inedible. My husband had a hamburger - he extracted several hard bony looking items from it, and the only reason why he did not leave hungry (like myself) is because he had good portion of chips. Our Croatian friend fortunately had pasta dish - which was reasonably good, although not exceptional. We will not be going back, which is a pity as Tunbridge Wells desperately needs new places to eat. However, I truly feel sorry for my guest as her experience of Jamie's Italian was far below anything she expected. I am now in the comfort of my kitchen and looking forward to a lovely cheese sandwich! 
-4	 Called in for lunch on way back from Carlisle meeting.  Took 10 mins before any staff appeared at the bar to take order then a further 40 minutes to produce 2 bland sandwiches. No apology for the delay.  It cost £15.30 for the 2 with coffees. Feeling very short changed and wishing we had chosen somewhere else.   
-4	 We've been trying to contact this place for over a month several times a week and no one ever responds or picks up the phone.  Such a shame as we were hoping to book for a large group of people. 
-4	 Visited here today and have to say for such a nice nice venue standards and service was poor. Got there about 2 pm yesterday for food after visiting London and was a little disappointed with the service. Food was good and well presented until a huge brown hair was found In our sharer dish. No check back was done on out food in the first place and when complaining the waiter did take the food away but was no apologies or and talk as in to what was going to be done about it. So was left in limbo. He came back 7 minutes later and asked if I would like a it done again. 7 mins does not seem long but when your partner is eating and you no food it a long time. Food did come back about 10 mins later again but once again no apology or check back. Staff also to indulged in talking at the bar than doin work or talking to friends. The food however was nice and we'll presented but this was the first time I been here and have to sat it will be the last which is a shame for such a nice place. Sorry to say but you staff service by the male waiter and staff just standing around talking in was a poor show so shall not be returning. 
-4	 Booked a Christmas Meal here. We were absolutely frozen, kept our coats on all night. Asked for more logs on Fire, was told they weren&quot;t allowed to stoke it up. Meal was cold too, served on cold plates. Waitress told us that Last Orders was 9-45!!! Considering we had booked in November, Pre-Booked our food the Evening was a total disaster. NO WE SHALL NOT BE GOING AGAIN 
-4	 I have been to this place before and the wife said give it a second chance for lunch .It was total rubbish and your mad if you go to this place .I can not call it a restaurant because it is not .Starters were a prawn rocket crayfish salad and i had creamy mushrooms.There was two tiny pieces of bread and a big pile of very salty creamy mushrooms .I had to ;leave some as the salt was too much . Main was risotto for the wife with mussels prawns etc and i ordered gnocchi with dolcelatte .The gnocchi was not fresh .Sauce was salty again and the whole thing was sickly .It was not dolcelatte something else but extremely salty. The wife ,her risotto was smelly ,very fishy which means it was not fresh .We had cappuccino in the smallest cups ever Rip off at over £2 a cup .We did not pay for mine .Two starters two coffees and one main ,£30 .Words fail to express how bad this place is .Would rather starve .Must say that the girls serving were great .Saying this place is a rating of one for terrible is been over rated !!!! 
-4	 Deteriorating quality! Eaten here a number of times including our office Christmas party and it's definitely going downhill. They have lost good managerial staff, the menu is now limited and extremely poor and the food itself very average for the price. We did not book on a Thursday but were offered a table in the bar providing we ordered quickly as the restaurant was fully booked and filling fast, We sat down at 19:20 and ordered straight away. Relaxing over a bottle of wine, we were told (with no warning) that our table was required at 20:30. Had we been told this prior to sitting down we would have driven into Alderley Edge for proper service in a decent restaurant. The hostess seemed completely out of her depth as if they were overbooked and it certainly seemed like organised chaos. She not aware that she had completely ruined our evening. Like a previous review, if we could have given a zero we would have. The bar and bar staff are fine (apart from one elderly gentleman being asked if he wanted a glass with his bottle of Becks!) but we would not recommend the restaurant to family, friends or clients of our business. 
-4	 We were recommended to visit the Canteen at Nailsworth as we wanted a simple snack and drinks. This was about 2.40pm, the Canteen closed at 5.00pm. On approach there was a sign come in to drink and eat. There were at least 3-4 tables free in what looked like a reclamation yard? none of the tables had been cleared but we assumed they were busy and thought we'd give it a go. on the menu they had salads and sandwiches. about 10 mins later two members of staff came out to say that they had sold out of all food except for brownies? we assumed they were joking!? especially as I had already seen a huge cake selection. when we questioned it they confirmed that we could only order brownies. I was amazed anyone runs out of all ingredients to their menu 2 and a half hours before closing. especially when the shop is opposite a greengrocers. We really got the impression that the staff had worked as much as they had wanted to that day. The restaurant had made an attempt at being arty to compensate for the poor location but they can not pull it off with filthy tables and poor customer service. We found the staff really quite offensive and we certainly wouldn't go back there. 
-4	 This place has been made famous by channel 4 television, so while i was staying in the Axminster district decided to call in for coffee & light bite. I had barely sat down before someone came over & asked what i wanted I asked for a cappuccino with no chocolate on top, then started to look at the menu that was on the table. There was only drink choices in this menu, so i went to the counter to see want was on offer & went back to the table. The cappuccino came, the waitress put it on the table & i pushed it away saying i ordered one with no chocolate on top. I asked about having a pasty or sausage roll & was told SORRY ONLY SERVING CAKE ALL OF THE PASTRY'S ARE FOR TAKEAWAY ONLY. sO I GOT UP & LEFT. & went next door to Route 66 lovely food there!!!!!! 
-4	Went at lunch time, hardly any choice, tried the Mexican, was all stone cold, pointed it out to the waiter, he was not bothered, the international cuisine was cold pizza, chicken nuggets and chips, wanted something hot for my son so went to the pasta bar and politely asked for bolognaise, so called chef, I e expert at heating food on a gloryfied camping stove shoved a plate at me and said choose your pasta and meat and I will cook, not friendly, not nice, avoid
-4	 I had booked a table at Giggling Squid, Hove for 26 February. I really like Thai Massaman Veggie Curry and, as they only had meat versions on the menu, I asked them if they could make me a veggie one. To my absolute horror, I was then informed by the waitress that none of their vegetable curries (with one exception of a particularly 'hot' one) were suitable for vegetarians and, in any event, the GS chain of restaurants use a shrimp based paste in the majority of their recipes!! Unbelievable!! Nowhere on their menu is this fact clearly stated! There must be lots of vegetarians and shellfish allergy sufferers eating their 'vegetable' dishes without being aware. This is actually very dangerous for those with allergies as a lot of shellfish allergy sufferers choose a vegetable dish, thinking they are opting for a 'safe' option! Also, a lot of vegetarians will assume that a veggie curry is suitable for vegetarians. I believe GS do not make this fact clear as they do not want to alienate vegetarians as they make up such a large customer base. I believe GS are being very underhand in not making the presence of the shellfish paste in the majority of their food clear to customers. The waitress didn't have a clue quite frankly! She also said it didn't matter as it was 'only a very small amount of shellfish paste'??!! I have also read in another review on TA that one customer was told there was even shrimp paste in their corn cakes in the sharing starter platter that GS have described as 'Vegetarian' on their menu. I can't verify that but, from the staff's apparent lack of knowledge, or concern, regarding dietary requirements/allergies, I would not be in the slightest bit surprised!   We had already ordered our drinks but obviously wanted to leave. They made sure they charged us for the drinks and we left the restaurant in disgust! The situation was made even worse (if that's possible) when on leaving the restaurant, I spoke to some other waiting staff on the ground floor, one of whom informed me that I could have requested a vegetarian curry be made especially for me. This advice was in direct contradiction to what the waitress had told me upstairs. In other words, there is no consistent or clear message in regard to this issue from the staff. I can only suggest all vegetarians and shellfish allergy sufferers avoid this restaurant chain as it is better to be safe than sorry. 
-4	 I cannot comment on the food as after ordering our lunch we waited for over 1 hour and despite reminding staff that we were still there we sat watching later arrivals eating and leaving which is upsetting when you are really hungry; so we left. We shall not return. 
-4	 I booked the Valentines Day 3 course meal set meal for £19.95 (that came with complimentary Prosecco, if booked online)  I can understand that as it was Valentines day they were quite busy, however this is not an excuse for terrible Customer Service. The first thing that got my back up was when the waiter served us the Prosecco in Wine Glasses and his answer to this was: ''We have run out of the fancy glasses'' yet every other couple had the champagne flutes on their tables???  Not even a sorry. So because i'm not paying for it, i can just get any old glass??? Also one of glasses had dirt marks all over it.  Then they had run out of Chocolate fudge cake, and was abruptly told to choose anything of the other dessert menu. I chose this Branch as the previous Prezzo i had been to near me was also very bad: cold/burnt pizza, non-attentive staff.   Extremely annoyed that's i didn't complain there and then and suffered in silence, (only cause my partner didn't want any fuss, and was still nice enough to leave them a tip!!! 
-4	 We had the misfortune to eat at this restaurant recently for a friends Birthday. We'd previously been to the venue for drinks, but never eaten there. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good experience. Due to the numbers in our party, we were restricted to their Christmas menu. Not a problem as there were a number of choices for each course. However, it was quite apparent that each dish was mass produced, with no care, attention or skill. My partner ordered the soup to start. Although we'd ordered a good 30 minutes before the starters arrived, they had obviously forgotten to put the relevant cutlery out. After two requests, the spoon made it's way over to our table, via a quick chat with other members of staff and a check on another table across the room. By which stage the watery, no better that a packet mix soup had gone cold. The dish was replaced with a pork terrine, which was bland and tasteless. The mains were possibly even worse. The lamb was the most horrendous I've ever eaten. I wouldn't be surprised to find out it was processed and frozen, prior to being thawed out and dolloped on my plate! I thought I could rescue my hunger with vegetables, but these were in very short supply on our table!  Finally, the cheese board - a safe decision? But no, this was obviously prepared a few hours in advance and arrived in an extremely 'sweaty' state.  The service wasn't good either. Every request seemed to be a chore and far too much bother. I won't be eating here again. It's not exactly cheap and for those prices I would expect so much more. We even looked across the street at the Gourmet Burger Bar and drooled. In fact we had to make a quick detour to the local chicken takeaway on our journey home! The only good thing was the ambiance, and that was probably down to the group of people we were with. 
-4	 I have been to much better Italian Restaurants than this, the food was'nt upto much and the prices for what you got were very inflated (because of the name) not recommended at all. 
-4	Went on Saturday, coffee was cold, tables needing cleaning and clearing away. Was literally in there 20 mins and nothing was cleared away!!!
-4	 Called into the Elveden Inn to check it out on Sunday for having family to stay over soon and found half of what was on the main and specials menu was not available. Waiters did not know what was and what was not available. When our choice did arrive only half of what we should have received was on the plate! What we did have was very nice. However, after deciding on the drastically reduced dessert menu - I chose a hot chocolate, only to be advised that they did not have any milk! Didnt get to complain as no one around and was exasperated when even the bill was incorrect!  Great setting just a shame about the experience especially when they cater for accommodation leaves you wondering what you will get for the next days breakfast! 
-4	 Echoing others comments this is a beautiful character pub with lovely views that should be a goldmine! Unfortunately completely ruined by the RUDEST STAFF and POOR MANAGEMENT!! I can understand that the Hotel may wish to keep some reserved space for it's residents especially if they are paying such extortionate prices! This is no excuse however for the shoddy, appalling treatment of their other customers. Although the 'public' bar is tiny there is plenty of space down below to create toilets and a pleasant eating area. My friend and I were actually looking to spend a fair amount of money on a good Fishy lunch but it proved hard enough to get a drink from the surly arrogant boy behind the bar. I gave Burgh Island the curtesy of emailing them first regarding my complaint in early September but have not received a reply!! Perhaps they should bear in mind that some of us peasants could actually have been potential customers for their hotel if we had been suitable impressed! Also pile of old mattresses and rubbish on the island not a good look! 
-4	 Awful place, rude staff and cold food. Will not be returing. The staff didnt look like they had a clue what they were doing, it was an awful experience and i will not be coming here again. 
-4	Used to be good food and good value. Since its been revamped the food is awful and overpriced. Won't be visiting again,
-4	 We had the worst experience possible in Lala's. It is family tradition to visit for birthdays and celebrations and the meal and service was amazing throughout the evening. We received the bill for 10 customers and paid immediately. 3 guests left the restaurant and whilst the rest of the guests were awaiting their taxi, a member of staff brought the bill back to say that they had undercharged us by £60. Apparently, they had not added up the bill correctly as drinks were not included in the total price. We did not disagree with the price as it was good value but the manner in which it was approached was disgraceful. The man added up the total on a calculator and just sat there in silence before stating that it was our fault and never bothered to offer discount for poor service and ruining a birthday party. The overall manager never bothered to apologise for such inconvenience and I must add that there was our table of 10 and another table of 6 in the whole restaurant so it was not an error made due to rushing and a busy restaurant. Absolutely despicable that they could be so rude and disrespectful to regular customers, clearly not accepting their mistakes and responsibilities. Such a shame, maybe another Lala's restaurant further away will be a better option. 
-4	 I tend to have low expectations when I go out for Italian food as being Italian myself makes me rather bias. However, the fact this restaurant tries to pass itself off as Italian is just shocking. I ordered the garlic pizza bread, which was a thick doughy mess with tasteless cheese on it and it didn't even taste of garlic.   I then had the Tagliatelle Arrabiata, which I asked for extra chilies with and thank God I did since it masked the taste, or lack of it! It basically tasted as if someone had poured a tin of tomatoes over the pasta without adding salt or anything. Oh and the pasta was also all gloopy because some 'chef' does not know how long to cook it for - it says it on the packet so even an idiot can do that bit right!   The only reason I ate here was because I was staying in the hotel, I should have gone across the road to Frankie and Benny's for a meal that at least could have some flavour. If you are going to call yourself an Italian restaurant, at least get the basics right! You can't charge money for food that is worse than what I have been served at a friends house, who can barely boil an egg! 
-4	 I rated 1 star as that is minimum I could give. This place has gone downhill & would struggle to give half star rating. Visited bank holiday Monday & as soon as we arrived was told certain foods were unavailabe as they had run out. Waited ages for food & when it finally arrived, It looked like a child's portion. All 5 soap dispensers in ladies toilets were empty. Being bank holiday unprepared for volume of customers. Bad management.  Ps Still waiting for dessert as I 'm writing this. 
-4	 we only fancied a few chips as we weren't going to eat until 10.30 at night - so at about 4 oclock we called into the Happy Haddock and ordered a large portion of chips to share between us in the car ...... it was the smallest bag of chips for £2.00 you ever saw. I dread to think what the small portion would look like. The bags are thick and posh - maybe save a bit on them and give a better portion. Have used this shop when it was Junes for over 40 years and always got a fair lot of tasty chips. Won't be returning - standard right down for taste, left a fatty after taste, so many bits in the bottom of the bag which were hard and cold. So disappointed and annoyed I didn't take a picture 
-4	 Had a meal with my family didn't go over the top as far as ordering was concerned & we just had just one glass of wine and 2 Diet Cokes. I was stunned when the bill came to almost £70.00 for 3 people. Because they were busy I just paid & went home.  But I checked on their website and found that they had overcharged me by £22.00, as I had the bill I went in & spoke to one of the waiters who was curt & rude, will not be going back as I've since seen other reviews very similar. 
-4	My husband and I came here quite often and had good meals so it was recommend to our friends  However after last night Friday 18 th April for lots of reasons we won't be returning or recommending for reasons that follows We were joined by two of our friends who were looking forward to trying something new  We hadn't sat down long and were asked had we chosen off the menu a couple of minutes later waitress returned we choose our starters and mains and were going to order two sides of steam vegetable waitress said portion was rather large and one would be enough so that was helpfull  Starters arrived friends husband was sent back as it came with pickles on salad it wasn't stated it was promptly replaced with no problem twice waitress came to take starters away when I hadn't finished no sooner had the starters been took away the mains were sent out we had to srnd them back as my husband had left the table as we didn't think they would be brought out almost immediately  No sooner had my husband sat down about five minutes later the meals were returned minus the portion of vegetables we asked for them was told they were coming it obvious they hadn't ordered them we all stated to eat our meals my friends chicken was loverly hers husbands battered fish was so soggy but didn't like to complain and my husbands steak want well done again didn't want to complain there chips were soggy my duck was presented loverly but wasn't hot I sent it back it when the vegetables eventually arrived it was returned minutes later still not any hotter except the sauce on top of the duck I returned it again was asked by owner did I want it hear up I said no not again was offered another meal of choice I declined as my husband and friends were nearly finished and by then I wasn't in the mood the owner again apologised at no point was there a goodwill gesture my husband and friend order dessert they ate we got bill nearly £100.00 pound for  Four starters  Three mains Two desserts One coke two pints one glass of wine and one bottle of wine We wernt charged for the vegetables they wernt on bill  We asked to speak to owner to say how disappionted we were and that it was expensive to be told we didn't charged you for the duck!!!! we got another apology we said we won't be back and she shrugged her shoulders and that will be writing a review owner put her hands up in the air  All in all we felt rushed disappionted and a lot lighter in the wallet  
-4	 The service last night was dreadful. Too many young, untrained staff who preferred to gossip amongst themselves rather than serve. When they did attend they didn't know the details of the small menu, nor remember what you had ordered. The food was dry & unappetising, with withered vegetables & was highly overpriced. Such a disappointment as this used to be a good pub, serving delicious food with an excellent host. 
-4	 If you like waiting for 15 mins without being acknowledged once by any waiters, go here. Even if it's not busy. I live round the corner and have left this restaurant twice the service was so bad 
-4	 We had a provisional reservation for large Christmas party and were waiting for a call back for a deposit to secure it. I called the restaurant FOUR times and was assured everything was under control. Finally today we got a call and were told that there was no availability even though we already had a booking. Kylie was great when I spoke to her but a man there completely screwed up the reservation for our entire Christmas party and rather than being apologetic was rude. I have spent a good deal of money in The Living Room over the years as the food and cocktails are actually very good. However, it's impossible to feel happy going somewhere you are not looked after. The is plenty of choice in Manchester, particularly with an influx of excellent new restaurants and cocktail bars in Spinningfields on top of everything we already had. Not good enough.....watch out guys, there are plenty of people snapping at your heels....I certainly won't be bothering coming to your place again! we are looking forward to spending a lot of money in Piccolino's instead :) 
-4	Met up with my friend for a very long awaited evening out and came across Bellota. Being a lovely evening we chose to sit outside and ordered a chilled bottle of cava and half a dozen tapas. The waitress was very friendly and helpful and the cava superb. Unfortunately that's where our positive's end. We waited just over an hour for our food - for tapas!! And when it did arrive the food was not hot, just barely warm!! Extremely disappointing. We did have 2 dishes knocked off our bill when we complained, but the damage had been done. It wasn't as thought they were really busy as there was nobody sitting outside, and we noticed a couple of parties get up and leave as their orders had not been taken.
-4	 I'm italian and trust me, this restaurant is terrible, i ordered calamari fritti and penne alla carbonara...And...It was EVERYTHING TERRIBLE. I didn't eat nothing. This is not italian restaurant ant this is not italian food.  I put on my money on the rubbish.  Thank's Bugatti, you are the worst restaurant in London. 
-4	Went here for a birthday meal, what a disappointment. If you read the menu before you go, do not expect to find the range of food advertised, you get what they decide to put on. It is not quality food and seems to be for the masses, cheap and easily cooked. Staff are trying to take your plates before you have even finished eating and your glasses before they are empty!! For £12.99 per person there are much better quality places to eat. A real disappointment .
-4	 My fiancé and I came for a quick Thursday dinner and had the worst experience ever.  When 7 chicken wings cost 12.95, you expect  something better than average but... It was just microwaved, plain (unless oil is sauce or seasoning) wings. Super overpriced!  My fiancé had pasta - probably the worst pasta in his life and definitely the last meal at Henry's ever.  My food was clearly microwaved and so not worth the price.  We would never eat here again.   
-4	 Really unpleasant staff who demanded we put our pushchair down even though there was no one around us and it had been stowed out of the way! They watched in disgust as we unloaded buckets/spades etc to fold it down!  NO kids menu - we were just told we could get an extra plate and share! My 2 quiet we'll behaved girls pushed the buttons on the fruit machine right next to our table and the barmaid came over and told them to stop in a v unpleasant way.  Don't mind un child friendly places but st Ives harbour in August I don't understand why they would bother to alienate what must be they're key clientele!!! 
-4	 Visit today for lunch with friends. The staff were clearly selected for their looks not personality or intellect.  First challenge, a pint of Peroni. The girl couldn't work out which tap was which, despite the Peroni handle.  Next challenge, taking a lunch order for a group of 10. We all received our food at different times, despite ordering together. Items were missing, extra items brought that we had not requested. I ordered a chicken skewers (note the plural of skewers) salad. What I got was a bowl of lettuce, a couple of slivers of mozzarella, and 1 skewer of chicken. Had to ask for dressing, and for the mozzarella which was missing.  Next stop the toilets, which can only be described as grim. I actually had to make a toilet paper seat cover as it was so grubby. If the front of house was so dirty, it makes me scared what the kitchen is like. On the plus side, I doubt there was sufficient chicken in my salad to make me ill. To summarise, avoid at all costs. 
-4	Order drinks and ice cream deserts for three people. Went upstairs to wait. Two deserts came which were Sundaes. It was ice cream in a glass!! Ice cream sundaes are suppose to have a few layers with chocolate sauce and separation of either fruit or a different topping. My sister had to wait at least 20 minutes for her deserts which was a crepe, after reminding the waiter 4 times. It was delivered to the wrong table!!! My sister had to go over and lift the desert off the table. :/ Still with no ice cream! The waiters were extremely nice and very apologetic. I then told them that the sundae was awful as IT WAS JUST ICECREAM! The boss then came up to me and he was also very rude and only cares about money and not about my issue. He said that everyone complained then he would money. That's fine but don't advertise a glass of icecream as a Sundae. (P.s you put sauce over the glass before putting in scoops of ice cream). However, the boss then gave me a strawberry milkshake instead after persuading him which was quite nice. Other good point is that your staff are a credit to the boss. They were apologetic and seemed a tad scared of the boss. Try and be nicer mister boss to both staff and your customers.
-4	 Dirty tables - food thrown at you when busy ....... Very sad as I really like JO! When busy it seemed short staffed - the floors were also dirty the loos had no paper etc etc I can't how disappointing it was..... 
-4	 Totally rude rude rude rude rude staff and managers  filthy place never ever again place needs a good clean how long can it last like this is the question surely not long not atall happy how can you run a place like this   
-4	 Over priced, not impressed with quality or service. Parking not easy either and not worth the effort. We went in hungry and came out hungry too. 
-4	 It was supposed to be a nice meal on Mother's Day but it was the worst experience! Pre-ordered food came after 2 hours wait, all wrong not what we ordered. Vegetables came uncooked in a strange massive bowl (i think that supposed to be not for 1 but for 6-8 people and was waiting to be put into oven in the kitchen). Water's were not helpful, some ignored us totally. The table had splinters on the edges, so my outfit was damaged. The manager never turned up when we wanted to confront all the disappointments. They lost a big business which was one of the reasons I went there! Shame. 
-4	 Beautiful food but waiting two hours and being told the driver had left at 8.25 and still no delivery 45 minutes later and still waiting! If you fancy an Indian for dinner I suggest you order pretty early! Very disappointed 
-4	 we booked on line the night before for a Sunday carvery, received no email response back from fissions so presumed all was ok. Arrived at gissons and advised management that we had booked online, We were than informed that they were too busy to check the computer every five minutes for bookings! Why than over the option!! The manager than decided to do a rant and rave in front of us to all staff there which was very unprofesional and made us THE PAYING CUSTOMER uncomfortable. Embarrassed to what th do next either stay or leave we decided to stay but cut our visit short due to stressful atmosphere created by the manager! Would not recommend it to any of our friends or family, wanted a nice Sunday carvery we received the worse customer service ! 
-4	 I booked a table here for my birthday. When I arrived with my family they claimed to have no record of my booking and refused to sort anything out claiming that our party of eight was too large for a Saturday night. When I explained that it was my birthday and it would be difficult to go elsewhere the woman just shrugged her shoulders and turned her back on me, which left me feeling very upset indeed. There is a happy ending to the story though as we walked up the road to Zizzi's where we had a great meal and a bottle of bubbly on the house too! 
-4	 This was the worst meal I have eaten in my entire life. Customer service was non existent and they looked down their noses at my family. The food was disgusting and every single dish was cooked in chilli. My mouth was on fire even with a simple dish like noodles. The portions were tiny and they watched you eat from the bar area. 1 small bowl off egg fried rice I portion of fried noodles with onion 4 small spring rolls I portion of crispy duck 1 portion of prawns in garlic butter 3 water 1 wine come to the grand total of £89. We left hungry but in agony. Never ever will I subject myself or anyone I know to this experience again. 
-4	 We went here tonight as a family group, to be honest the food was not ideal, hot and sour soup was tasteless, sizzling duck didn't sizzle.... Nothing really tasted fresh and the noodles were greasy. There were 6 of us and the bill came in at just under £160, I would much rather have had an Indian for half the price or a take away, or even a cheese sandwich! Staff were very efficient and friendly until the guy at the end announced 'All done, then I need the table my customers are waiting OK' despite the fact that we had been waiting 15 minutes to pay the bill. A fairly unsatisfactory end to a sub standard meal. 
-4	Went here with kids because saw it advised on Facebook sponsor link. I am American and can be a bit picky with BBQ. My English wife agreed that everything we got was lacking seasoning.....not hot......and could have been made by my teen aged son. The ribs were dry and I had to send them back as I could barely get them to separate. They took it off the bill and as we were starving we ate the starter but did not enjoy it at all. I believe it was wayyy to expensive for very average or below average food. I don't know why restaurants feel it necessary to throw a load of different ingredients onto a plate and call it American. There was nothing American about the food they served in there. Basically hated it. Hope others have better luck.
-4	Went on Mother's Day with family and we won't be going back. The orders for three adults never arrived despite two orders to check and the parts of the dishes were missing (we had to ask where the potato was for the three dishes of dosa where it clearly stated on the menu it came with potato). The service was terrible and generally inattentive. Disappointing all round and wouldn't recommend it.
-4	This was quite frankly the worst restaurant meal of any kind that we have had the misfortune to 'eat'! We cannot think of one single positive to take from our dining experience apart from leaving the restaurant.  Rude and abrupt serving staff. No cutlery on the table. Incorrect order was written down, resulting in a lamb dish rather than chicken as requested. Cobra beer was actually warner than the food!!! Food was served cold. Main course was returned and when the replacement meal arrived at the table it was clear that the meat (lamb) had been taken from the origional course and replaced with chicken. Food was still cold and a side order was missing.  Tandoori mixed grill contained less meat that a sparrow's knee cap!!!! The Tarka Dall resembled something one might expect to be drained from an abscess, green and nasty!! Senior manager was useless when we complained about the quality of the food and overall service and said 'I will lose my job if I reduce your bill'!!!!  Manger wasn't much better. We had a 20% off voucher which had been handed to us whilst walking up Drummond Street.....the manager had the cheek to say I will take 20% off when everyone in the restaurant had the same voucher!!!  Overall it was the worst dining experience we have ever had. Quality, temperature of food and service was appalling. Don't go there!!!
-4	 Saturday night, rare dinner out as a couple, sadly ended up paying quite a lot for a rubbish meal and dire customer service.  Steaks were poor. Cooked nicely but the meat was as tough as it comes. Soggy chips, tinned and/or frozen veg. Soggy calamari. Soggy, obviously frozen onion rings etc etc. You get the picture. At £15 a main, I've had so much better and expect so much better.   We would have complained, we even would have asked for steak knives... but the waiting staff were totally indifferent - took two requests from two different people just to get the bill (and it certainly wasn't that busy). It appeared that the owner's son was sat near us though, and he received much more attentive service...  The whole place is sticky with grease, and has the feel of somewhere not even trying to be good at what it does. It will settle for being mediocre and take your cash regardless.   We skipped desserts and ordered an early taxi home - I'd honestly suggest you skip it altogether. Plymouth has better restaurants on offer. I WISH we'd taken the other negative comments on here on board first! 
-4	 This is hands down the worst meal I've had in a long time. However more than that the restaurant manager was not interested in my feedback (despite it being asked for) I was met with &quot;we've had some good feedback from the other customers&quot;. Not helpful.  Started with an amuse bouche that did not amuse me, a spicy concoction on a small piece of what appeared to be granite topped with a pate made from duck - very unpleasant.   Followed by goats cheese that was fridge cold but had been gas gunned, on top of an over dressed, limp with dressing salad that was so vinegary it brought tears to my eyes. I asked the waitress (a12 year old) &quot;is this supposed to be cold&quot; and was told it was supposed to be warm, so asked for it to be warmed...... Apparently - following my feedback and according to the restaurant manager it's warmed, left to get cold and served - huh?  This was followed by roast beef - inedible, overcooked, tough and too thickly carved - undercooked and under-seasoned veg, accompanied by a really surprisingly good Yorkshire pudding that was the size of a side plate. But it was far too much food. The gravy was bitter and tasted floury - but as I said the yorkie was the highlight - OF THE WHOLE MEAL.  Pudding, I went for ice cream as I thought it was the safest option... I was hopeful the chef wouldn't mess this course up.... The chocolate soil was in fact cocoa powder and made me cough, the chocolate and vanilla ice creams were ok, the strawberry was icy in a really unpleasant way and the raspberry coulis was dire.  My feedback was dismissed.   Oh an as an aside the driveway up to the beautiful building was littered with potholes.   Sufficed to say, this with be my only visit to this establishment. Cost nearly £80 for two including a pretty dire bottle if wine - which they replaced with another equally dire bottle. I wasn't drinking because I was driving but that's hardly the point. 
-4	This place does not take reservations. However, you will see a MASSIVE Q outside the restaurant. Sometimes the waiting times can be between 1hr-2hrs. I simply wonder why & what for!?!  First of all I would like to say that this is a huge marketing scam!!! I was tricked but hopefully you won't so please keep reading.   I tried to get a table at this restaurant many times but being hungry and all I never been able to wait for such a long time. One day I was passing by and saw a shorter Q and decided to wait to be seated. After 40 min wait we were seated.  The restaurant is huge and has lots of tables at the lower ground floor / ground floor & first floor too.  We were seated at the lower ground floor level. When we stepped in there were only two tables taken. The others - at least 7/8 tables plus the bar were all empty!!!   During my 40 min wait outside in the Q I did not see 30 people coming out the restaurant making it now empty!!!  We were simply shocked but decided to order. We were given the menu and we were told the specials: steak from New Zealand at a ridiculous price!!!   The menu is not really a menu. You don't have choices. Is either meat with lettuce or meat with chips.  We ordered. The meat with salad comes. I was simply horrified! Shocked! First presentation is awful, the meat looks disgusting, the taste is Disgusting!!! I have been ripped off!!!!  So the meat I think is boiled or steamed or something and then grilled / looks awful when presented and it's extremely SMALL!!! The most tiniest pieces of meat I have ever seen in my life in a restaurant! Even the Michelin Star restaurants serve more food!!! The salad is a quarter of a tiny bit.  I left this place hungry and went to Ceconni's Restaurant in Burlington Gardens for more food!   Customer Service?! Please leave it! Young students serving with no kind of training... I need to ask my manager, I don't know, I will get back to you.  This is not a restaurant! Simply a huge scam !!!   That's it! Enjoy if you can!   
-4	 Ordered the crab salad and was told they had run out due to Bank Hol, so chose the faggots as a second choice that had also run out so chose Sirlion steak which was tough and I took it home for my dogs, the salt pot had a dirty crack down the side so I asked for it to be changed which they did, Our food took ages to arrive. We ordered a pot of coffee on our arrival and the dirty cups remained on the table throughout our meal. The ladies toilets were out of order. 
-4	 We were a party of five with two children. Service with a smile, very nice waiters...One of our party has had good previous experience. Tonight, however, none of us would return. We drank cocktais, as we thought !!! either the bar tender didn't have a clue, or, we were being ripped off, the latter appeared to be the case.  Salad bar medioca, hot food, chips ,potatoes, etc were cold. Meats served at the table was tough and tasteless, how can you go wrong with decent cuts of meat!!!!!! which is supposedly what your being charged for? Very disappointing 
-4	Recently ordered a takeaway meal from the Maypole and there were numerous problems with the order. When we phoned to explain, they kept us waiting about 10 minutes then hung up on us. We phoned again and it was abundantly clear they don't like any form of critisism so in the end I said I would put a report on them on the Internet and I was told to do what I like. I put a report on the Tiptree Facebook site and have been inundated with comments from customers who have had similar problems. Of the 65 comments only 2 said the meal was Ok. Others complained about the food, the price or the appalling service. Most said they would never go again, which is our view as well.
-4	 It took 15 minutes to get seated. We got a first plate of meat after ordering our food, but the waitor did not even ask what we wanted - they just brought out a platter of various cuttings. Our drinks arrived after we had finished eating the first platter. We then had to ask 3 different members of staff to bring us more meat, we got it about an 40-50 minutes after. In total we spent 3 hours in the restaurant with only 3 plates of meat served. The staff spoke very little english and kept saying it was too busy to serve us. The place is seriously over priced with no discount for children and £4 a pint of orange juice. I wont be eating here again and definitely recommend you stay away 
-4	 Waited over an hour for food, bar-maid was TERRIBLE and VERY rude! If this pub wanted to get anywhere, they'd have to get rid of her. Chef obviously doesn't know how to cook, food was definately NOT worth the wait! Was terrible, I wouldn't even feed it to a dog! I advise you NOT to eat here. 
-4	what an unbelievably horrible meal was served to me last night at The Moorhen.Firstly there was a 45 minute wait for service and the tables,chairs,bar etc.felt sticky and unpleasant.When the food finally arrived it was cold and the cutlery was dirty.Goodness knows what ingredients were used to make the cheese,onion and potato pie.It was a gloopy mess of over cooked staleness with a sort of Ryvita-looking &quot;pastry&quot; on the top which tasted like cardboard.The profiteroles were stale and filled with artificial cream and NO chocolate.What little chocolate sauce there was had been dribbled around the rim of the dish to make it look classy but it was impossible to scrape up enough to eat.A simple cup of tea was disgusting,like pond water. Surely they can boil a kettle?There were also hordes of children running around,knocking my chair.I shall never return.
-4	 Just had a takeaway for two most of it went in the bin totally disgusting radio active like sauce andit comes to something when you have to slice the rice are there no good indians in cewe now2 
-4	 We decided to hold my Mum's 65th birthday lunch at the air balloon after having an enjoyable experience there a few years back. I am sad to say that this experience wasn't as enjoyable.  There were several items that we ordered from the menu that were not available as well as certain drinks.  We were disappointed by the scattered approach in the timing of bringing out the meals (resulting in two meals having to be taken off the bill) and the food that was served was of a very poor standard. The soup was inedible and had a burnt taste to it. The vegetables were raw, and there was no consistency in the same meals that were ordered. For example four of us ordered roast beef and we all had varying portion sizes.  I felt very sorry for the waitress because you could tell she was being let down by the kitchen, on what seemed like a less than busy restaurant. Although we didn't pay for two of the meals, which was an appreciated gesture, we would have much preferred to pay full price for an enjoyable family meal. 
-4	 The food was bland and cold, service was very slow and staff were unattentive. Drinks overpriced, and again bar service slow. Would give this restaurant nil points!!!! 
-4	 So noisy everyone had to shout to hear the person next to them. Awful food - sloppy, overcooked, didnt taste fresh, greasy rubbish. Waiters rushed off their feet, forgot orders. We were served about 16 meze dishes but there were no serving spoons - waiter looked surprised when we asked for some and produced 2 and a teaspoon. All very amateurish. Staff were nice but looked stressed out. 
-4	 Ordered food to be delivered. Been told food will be with us in next 40minutes. After 1hour i called and been told order is on its way. After 1.30mins my partner called and green chilli phone assistant said same. &quot;Food is on its way&quot; partner told him that we are waiting over twice a deliver time abd we dont....phone was switched off!!! Shop assistant finished call with us! SO RUDE NEVER EVER GOING TO ORDER THERE AGAIN!!!!AND WE ARE LOCAL!!!!WE ARE DISCUSSED and so disappointed!!!! Terrible.....he should be fired!!!! 
-4	My friends and family have eaten there this evening and what a shocking meal. My sister sent hers back and the second one just as bad. My sons salmon was over cooked, mine was tasteless, and as for the rest well ..... What made it worse, they did not care and their attitude was &quot;well no one else complains'. All I can say is either people do not complain (we complained in a polite manner and did not make a fuss) or....... We eat out a lot and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I am baffled as to why this place is so busy. It's noisy, difficult to have conversation! I have been 2 or 3 times before and never enjoyed the food, it was only because our friend booked we went. Never ever again', no matter what.
-4	 Food was cold, staff hadn't got a clue on how to wait tables not their fault but lack of training! Menu lacking in choice, and I felt like I was sitting in a canteen as room large with no atmosphere and chair uncomfortable! Won't be going again and would not recommend to others. 
-4	Our daughter is at Uni in Harrow and we paid her a visit on Sunday 3rd November. The nearest place to eat was The Beefeater and as its a reputable chain we thought it would be fine. The place was empty at Sunday lunch time and now i know why. Yhe Sunday roast was recommended top us by the waitress, it was awful! 3 tiny roast potatoes that looked and tasted like the very cheapest frozen microwaved spuds ever, 3 pieces of raw cold brocoli and 3 cold carrots. A cold soggy yorkshire pud stuck to my plate with a small piece of meat next to it. Portion size for a small child. My husband was disgusted but i didnt want to make a fuss as my daughter had recommended it. On the way out the manager overheard me say &quot; that was the worst food i have ever been served&quot; and asked us to elaborate. My husband proceeded to say how awful the food was and that he has been put off Beefeaters for life. She refunded him the price of the food. We will visit our daughter once a month with other family members but will never go back here. Sucha shame as its a lovley, clean building and should be packed to the rafters as we struggled to find any more local eateries.
-4	Two staff working, an hour for food and then it arrives raw in the middle of the burger, and the prawns are mushy. The waiting staff didn't seem that bothered and didn't charge us for the meals which makes me think this happens quite often.... absolutely disgusting and so so dangerous!!! Not the mention the guy behind the bar was putting a staw in people's drinks and taking sips. Vile.
-4	 Have been tonight for my sons 23rd birthday there were 16 people, the table was booked for 7pm, after getting drinks, we got given popadoms & dips, our &quot;meals&quot; started to arrive at 8.45, a bit of rice here & there then some main dishes started to appear that were lukewarm, some dishes arrived that were not even what had been ordered, my own dish never arrive so the rice I had got was cold, along with some other dishes that had gone astray, it ended up a complete farce, with one person ordering a chicken dish & getting a beef dish, it completely ruined the birthday celebrations, when the bill arrived it had vodka drinks added to it that no one had had, as we all bought our drinks separately? We paid for the meals that people ate but the rest we refused to pay for. They tried blaming it on being short staffed, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. 
-4	 just left this place and all I can say is that me and my family are hungry and annoyed. We Came here for my sons 4th birthday at around 8pm quiet late I know but we where all hungry and didn't want to cook. it was quite quiet other then a large table of about 15ppl and another family.  Waited about 10 minutes to be served but no one came over or even appeared for that matter some one to come so I went to the bar to order food where I was told that it's a full table service and he would send over someone so I returned to my table.  Waited a further 15mins for some one to come no one came. As it was getting quite late and my son was hungry I went back to the bar to ask then I saw two waitresses on the phone by there kitchen either texting or on Facebook probably no care in the world that people are awaiting to be served I couldn't be bothered waiting any longer so we left.   I worked in the restaurant industry both in the UK and USA for a number of years and have never seen a waitress as brazen as hiding by the rotisserie machine on their phone never mind if it was quiet or not it's something that you don't do front of house.  I have been here a number of times before and raved about it on here but after hearing a few stories over the last few weeks about very slow and poor customer service I thought it was just them moaning however after experiencing it myself today I think it's time the management team set a side some staff training days. something has clearly happens over the last few for this to happen a fair bit recently time to sort it out I think!  
-4	I never write bad reviews normally but had a bad meal made worse by terrible customer service so had to share. The steak was uneatable, they don't serve tap water, the prices were changed without explanation and when we queried these issues, and explained how bad the steak was, one member of staff was rude, argumentative and didn't even offer a apology, never mind a reduction on the bill! I will not be going again and wouldn't recommend!
-4	 After just visiting this place I can honestly say I have received he worst customer service I have ever received in my life!! We ordered 3 doner kebabs but instead got 3 wraps. When questioning the staff why we were not getting a doner we were told &quot;sorry but we only serve wraps&quot; If we had been told this in the beginning that would have been fine but to be told once we were paying that was unacceptable. We questioned the staff only to be told this is only what they sell was completely unacceptable. You have two boards - one showing wraps and one showing doners - so how can you serve them as the same thing?? Your Guys serving apologised but there was a guy who was in there that was extremely rude!! When we asked for his name he said it was none of our business and that we didn't need his name. He looked at us like we were scum!! I will NEVER return to this place apart from tomorrow when I plan on confronting the manager to tell them how terrible the customer service is as I am disgusted!! 
-4	 one word discusting! Minging food Minging staff, Minging PUB... AVOID!!!!! oh and the management don't care that there dogs poo all out back of pub... 
-4	 My friend held his birthday dinner in the private dining room which was great, however after finishing food we decided to sit in the bar for a couple of drinks. Big mistake!! After noticing that another guest was fast asleep, her friend decided to start being verbally abusive to myself and friend and our husbands. She threw lots of insults across at us and then the other members of her party did the same. At which point the male of their group was very aggressive with my husband and friend. They had literally sat and ignored everything that had been said. When were then asked by the security to leave and when I questioned why it was us and not them, we were told it was because they were residents. I'm still really upset about the whole incident and don't think that at 34 years old I should be verbally abused for no reason! It has really put myself and friends off going back there. 
-4	 Service was AWFUL!! When I completed my order online, it said we would receive it within 40 minutes. 1 hour passed and our order hadn't arrived, so I called Bamboo Street (number on website was incorrect so had to google the correct one).. The girl that answered the phone went to check where our order was, when she returned she told me that our ticket had been dropped on the floor so they hadn't even started making it yet!! The girl was so unapologetic but said she would 'try' to get it to the front of the que. After a FURTHER hour and a half our order still hadn't arrived so I had to call again!! The same girl went to go and check and said she thinks it's on it's way but will call us if there are any further delays. Our order finally arrived after 2 and a half hours but to our surprise it was wrong! I'm vegetarian and instead of my vegetarian main, they had given me some kind of chicken dish! Great! I had totally given up by this point, didn't want to wait anymore but felt I had to express how disappointed I was to the company. When I called and explained to the same girl, all she could offer us was someone collecting the wrong dish and them cooking the correct one. Didn't really want to wait another 2 and a half hours, so declined! I said that I would be writing a bad review and the girl on the phone said 'that's fine'. Such shocking service, I will NEVER be ordering from here again. My partners food was bland on top of everything else too! 
-4	First of all, all the 5* reviews you see here are written by the staff and the bouncers to make the terrible reviews this place is rightly getting look better. To cut long story short - we paid 10 pounds each, since we were promised something else and didnt get it (they first said we could sit on the terrace), we asked for a refund, as soon as we asked for the refund a bouncer took me to a side, didnt listen to me at all, took my 2 vouchers i was given for 10 pounds each for a drink, threw them in some black whole and physically removed me from the venue (Im a blonde petit girl and I weight 50 kilos) even before I could explain why I wanted the refund. I looked at him shocked and he said 'silly girls'. I am very polite and I never raise my voice. He did not have any reason to treat us like this, unless some personal frustration.    The Longer story: My story is similar to the other here I see, I was talked into going to Ruby blue by a promoter on Leicester square. The promoter said we could sit outside on the terrace which looks very nice. We came up to the entry, bouncers let me in without my ID, we go up the stair through a smelly corridor arrive to a dark room with terrible music, then we notice there is stairs upstairs which is where the terrace is. The waitress lady who we followed upstairs turned around and said 'cant you read?', so we went downstairs to ask for a refund as the only reason why we entered that place was the terrace. When I was downstairs asking for a refund the bouncer asked me to step outside, took my drinks vouchers and physically removed me from the venue. For not real reason, I was not impolite and I did not raise my voice which would be the only reasons I believe you need to remove somebody.  AVOID THIS PLACE. RIP OFF.
-4	The bright orange paintwork should have set the alarm bells a ringing and that indescribable smell of fat and yuch should have sent us a running, but no we stayed for possibly the worst dining experience in recent memory.  Platitudes in service could not mask the simply appalling food - when you order 'bouillabaisse' you at least expect some form of sauce rather than the bowl of dry rice which was set in front of me. The menu promised so much and delivered so little. Seafood which should have been returned from whence it came rather than served to paying guests, dry bread that tasted of yeast and even chips which were hard, undercooked and, according to my colleague, simply disgusting !   There are lots of devine Belgian beers on the menu and perhaps this is a deliberate attempt to get you so completely and utterly drunk you can't eat, don't want to eat or can't put your finger on what made you puke.  If you are looking for somewhere to eat, try anywhere other than here.
-4	 As its half term I decided to go here due to the fact its one of the only places that has a play area next door. So spent an hour in Wacky Warehouse which kids enjoyed although a bit hit and miss with me and my husband. Hubby got 2 lattes and asked for more sugar as there was none out to which 1 lady said there was none left. I actually found a hair (nothing like ours or even the 2 ladies working which was even more worrying) in my latte so went back and got a replacement and when I asked for more sugar the lady ( a different one who served hubby) got a huge box of them out of the cupboard.  When we left to go next door we found our own table and went to the bar pretty much straight away to order as we had read the menu in the kids area. WELL THIS WAS WHERE IT GOT BAD!  TAKE 1- Go to order starters, mains and childrens food- get told theres no prawn cocktail. So hubby comes back to me to get an alternative to which I didnt want anything else so we scrapped our starters. Hubby queues up again as the manager had to serve other people whilst my husband came to check my order.  TAKE 2- hubby tells the manager whos taking orders to not worry about starters instead just our mains plus the kids order which would have been toad in the hole and a wrap platter- get told they dont have the bits to do a wrap platter ( this only included chicken strips, chips, salad and the actual wrap itself). So husband has to leave the queue AGAIN to come find out what else my daughter wants.  Husband queues up for the 3rd time in which point the queues very long and he sees the manager constantly picking his nose whilst taking orders!!  TAKE 3- after waiting in the queue again he gets seen again by the manager with another substitute to my daughters order, childs chicken curry..... GUESS WHAT? THEY DONT HAVE ANY!!! By now hes queued and tried to order taking 20minutes and gotten no where so he tells the manager hes had enough and we were going to leave. He did hear the manager say something behind his back but unclear as to what.   Best advice.... DONT BOTHER GOING HERE!!!!!  Only 2 people behind the bar during busy hours. Tables left half set. And 1 VERY RUDE manager.    
-4	 Today my friend and I visited the cafe in order to enquire after a job advertised in the window. However, the manager was extremely rude to us, and almost had my friend in tears. Not the way you expect to be treated when applying for a job, never mind entering a cafe. We were considering grabbing a bite to eat from the cafe as it smelled delicious, however, after the disgusting way she spoke to us, we will never be returning again, bar to make a subsequent complaint.  I don't know about the food - as I say, it smelled delicious, although the prices seem a tad high for an independent food outlet - but the service was almost comically ridiculous and I would suggest that the lovely atmosphere they claim to exude is 'faked', hence the rather bad pun in the title of this review. Personally would warn others against making a visit, 
-4	 Food cold, staff rude, will not get you anything other than what is out in the buffet pots even though most of the time they are either empty or have very little in them and god forbid you ask them to replace the contents with more food. Buffet meal but you would be better off going somewhere else. Manager rude and would not allow us to move seats even though the place was empty. Not a very nice experience will never go in here again 
-4	Decided to give this place a go for dinner with my wife. Looks like a nice enough place and ince sat down it took a bit before we could order when there was maybe 5 other people there. We ordered some crispy gyoza and ramen plus some green tea.  The gyoza was coated in some salt which was in all honesty not nice, also our green tea hadnt arrived so order some water and asked for tea again. The ramen arrive and i had the classic one whereas my wife had the spicy one. In the nicest possible way, my one was disgusting and way to salty. The spicy one looked like one i made last night. Also my one was so salty that my wife could even taste it througj her cold which onliterated her taste buds. As such we got the bill and at which point our tea finally arrived!!. Requested they take the service charge off, paid and left. This has left a very salty taste in my mouth so my advice is stay away if you want some decent food.
-4	 Seated by a moody waitress who probably said about ten words to us in the entire duration of our short sitting… When taking our order, the same waitress scowled at me when I asked if a salad was served warm and when I was given a disappointing answer with no alternative offered, I asked if I could change my order – to more scowling.  Food was beyond mediocre, the meatballs came with overcooked, soggy, mushy pasta and the crab spaghetti could have been made at home – Absolutely nothing special and lacked any flavour, therefore shocking value for money.   We also cleared out pretty quickly as the already noisy restaurant was greeted by a one year old’s birthday party. Safe to say, we won’t be returning to Jamie’s Italian, either in St Albans or elsewhere. 
-4	 Visited Trattoria Sapori with my boyfriend, his sister and her boyfriend and we were very disappointed. The food took ages to come, and when we asked one of the staff how much longer it would be the response we got was: 'I don't know.'   The food arrived and the butternut squash risotto tasted of water/air, the brunch was lukewarm and the Parma salad came without any avocado! We complained to the manager who came across very patronising and rude, calling us 'darling' repeatedly and excusing the foods tardiness and tastelessness due to a 'busy Sunday' - which wasn't really that busy. She refused to take the salad off the bill, although taking off the risotto, informing us she would get avocado and add it to the salad.  She arrived back to the table 5 minutes later apologising and saying they had ran out of avocado, and now would take it off the bill.   The pizzas looked nice so if you are going to go I would stick to them and not venture anywhere near the risotto or salad. The juice machine was also broken.   Disappointing visit as it had been recommended by a local friend so we expected better. 
-4	 will never go back again and I would suggest they buy some champagne glasses as 6 of us had to share 2! 
-4	 We went here for our Christmas night out. The food was terrible all cheap processed ingredients. The Kleftiko came with carrots and Brussels not very Greek!  They packed so many tables in you couldn't even get through to get up to the bar and no staff were around to take drinks orders. We couldn't see the entertainment as there were so many people and tables in front of us.  We left early as we were so upset and gutted that our Christmas party was ruined.  Having been before and had a great time with good food it made it even more disappointing.  Really not worth the money and we will never go there again. 
-4	 We have just visited here for our xmas meal, we decided we would try somewhere different as we usually go to San Pietro. Unfortunately we will NOT be returning to Colosseo. The evening started off good, when we arrived the staff were helpful and got our drinks and took our order. We all ordered off the xmas menu, the starter were lovely however, everything just went downhill from there. We all ordered steak (medium) , when these were served they were not medium but well done and very tough, when the waiter asked if everything was ok, I said not really the steak is not medium, the waiters reply was 'ok, do you want me to change it?' (no apology). We did get 2 out of the 3 steak meals changed as they were not cooked correctly. When the steaks arrived they were a lot smaller than the previous ones. After the main, we were waiting for around 45 mins so had to ask for the desserts. The dessert was cheesecake, unfortunately the base of the cheesecake was very very salty. When the waiter cleared the desserts I asked for a glass of water which never came. Nobody asked if everything was ok with the meal, we then had to ask for the bill. Even when the bill came I had to day that we were not happy with the service, the waiters reply to this was 'I asked if everything was ok', which he didn't, after he tried to argue his point I then finally got an apology. However, there was it was only half hearted!! He then went over to tell his manageress after we had paid. The manageress came across and asked what was the problem, I explained that the experience was very poor, the food wasn't great and the price was silly for what we got. The manageress replied 'Well no one has complained before!!', this is the worst customer service I have ever had. When we were leaving she said 'if you come back again we will put a bottle of wine on the table'. We will not be going here again!! 
-4	 We returned to the Harbour to see whether it was just as good, if not better, than before the refurb but sadly we were very disappointed. It was undoubtedly the worst customer service I have ever experienced, so poor that we left without having anything to eat for lunch.   On arrival the restaurant was half full and it was clear that the staff were unable to cope. People were walking in and leaving within 2 minutes of being told it would be a &quot;5-10 minute wait to make an order&quot;. Giving the Harbour the benefit of the doubt, we sat down and ended up waiting over 30minutes to be seen to. After enquiring why the wait was so long we were told by the waitress serving in a very rude manner that the Harbour &quot;gives priority to booking customers&quot; and went on to ask &quot;so do you want me to ask how long your food will take or not?&quot; This made us feel unwelcome and seemed to imply that customers are ranked in order of importance. Therefore we decided not to bother ordering food, feeling as though we were simply a burden for them having not booked and left.   To allow customers to enter and leave without eating is simply unsatisfactory and if the Harbour is unable to cope with &quot;booked tables of 8&quot; alongside unbooked customers then staff should inform the customers that the restaurant is &quot;full&quot; rather than allow people to waste time waiting for food that may take hours to arrive. We were even given a business card to book in advance as we got up to leave but needless to say we won't be returning to the Harbour in the near future or advertising it in our holiday cottage in Seaton. 
-4	I used to love the White Horse when back to Cranbrook to stay with family now the place is a joke. The mangers are rude and Unprofessional you would think when the so need customers they may treat the ones who are in there well but you would be mistaken!!!! Last time I went in order a gin and tonic I was served the drink with no ice nor lemon in a warm glass straight out of the glass washer. As for the food Disgusting
-4	 LITERALLY YOU ARE PACKED IN LIKE SARDINES.  We were a hen party of 11. The place was heaving with bodies, HEALTH & SAFETY ISSUE ME THINKS is in order for this shocking so called traditional greek restraunt. You could not hear yourself think let alone able to talk to any of your friends next to you. Waiters constantly knocking the back of your chair because no room to get by when serving the food. Complete SHAMBLES. Be warned there is only 2 toiliets in this restraunt, very poor considering it holds 200 females most fri & sat nights for hen do's. A very small dance floor in the middle. Food absolutely repulsive, starters was a spoonful humous tarama 1 vine leaf & beans all out of catering packs. Mains was dry skewered chicken on bed of plain long grain rice with a iceburg lettuce garnish, absolutely shocking food nothing greek about that: No sauce was offered so all was dry as a bone. We did not stay for the disco. Basically we ate & ran,,,,we did not pay the £25 that was required off each of us after having words with the manager he charged £15 this was still to much..... PLEASE DO NOT GO THERE NOTHING NICE ABOUT THIS PLACE 
-4	 There is a forced set menu which was given to us in an extremely bad state with food and dirt markings all over it. A group of us had booked and when we got inside and sat down we got straight up and left. Cannot comment on the food however the atmosphere and presentation of the restaurant was awful. 
-4	 Went in yesterday to get some cake for my fiancé's birthday. Bought 4 different slices: peanut butter stack, carrot cake, cookies and cream gateau and something with butterscotch in it. Even more disappointing than the fact that the cakes all tasted similar (sickly sweet and poorly made) EVERY SINGLE ONE WAS COMPLETELY STALE. It's not even like the cakes looked old: most of them had one or two slices out at the time i purchased them.   If you fancy a piece of stale cake for around £4 then this place is greatly recommended. 
-4	 So far I've waited 55 minutes for battered sausage and chips x2. This really is not good enough for food that is supposed to be quick. There are still at least 4 more orders before us.  
-4	 I am very disappointed. I had gone to this restaurant with two other Vegan friends and ordered the vegetable momos. We ordered 4 servings of vegetable momos and specifically asked for the vegetable ones. However, we were served four servings of pork momos. I was unaware and bit into one, but as soon as I realised we had been served the wrong meal, we told the waiter.  After telling the waiter that we had been served this, the waiter did not seam apologetic and more annoyed that we didn't want to eat the food that he had served. He came across as very rude and said that it was our fault.  We received nothing for this mistake which is very upsetting because as a Vegan I would never want to participate in something that had caused animal abuse and feel very strongly about this. They even said that this had happened in the past so they clearly do not take it seriously enough. I will not be visiting the restaurant again. 
-4	 We are staying nearby in our campervan & decided to walk the mile or so to the pub as we had been told they do a great carvery. The place seemed quiet for a Saturday evening, but there were quite a few reserved tables. It wasn't at all clear what the procedure was to order meals so we had to ask a staff member if we could just sit down & order or prepay at the bar. A pint of stout, gin&tonic & 2 carvery tickets came to £21. The place seemed clinical & soulless but the food looked good for the money. Wrong! The roast beef was so tough it was practically inedible not so much like eating old reindeer, more like trying to chew the sleigh! The roast potatoes were undercooked Aunt Bessie frozen nasties; carrots & green beans we're ok but what that vile slime was over the cauliflower passing for cheese sauce is anyone's guess. We were really looking forward to a lovely meal; such a pity it was so awful.  
-4	 Went last week on Wednesday, normally have really good service here and always raving about this place! We got a table and ordered our drinks the nachos came before our drinks, which was cold (nachos) which we had no cutlery or napkins for whatsoever. We had to use the napkin under the dish to wipe our hands. The food took over an hour to get to us, which was cold when served we both hardly touched our meals, no check back or asking us if everything was okay. Then had to get the check whilst we were eating our food because it took too long. Then paid an extortionate 45 pounds asked us if we wanted our change which was very rude. All in all not great. Normally good service but this visit was shocking. 
-4	 If it's a decent latte you are after definitely avoid Kates Cottage! On entering the place we met the waitress who (without cracking a smile) informed us that they did latte. However it was revolting and tasted like the cheap dried instant coffees that you get out of sachets. I couldn't drink it and in fairness wasn't charged. We didn't eat there as the smell of grease was off-putting so I can't comment on the food. 
-4	 Booked for a table for 2 on Tuesday evening to check out what it was like with a view to booking a family meal in March. Read the reviews and was looking forward to it. Unfortunately we were the only ones in the restaurant (there was a party in a side room), this would not have been a problem to us as there was a general buzz. However, the nice waitress told us that they had a new head chef and there were several items off the menu. She had written them down as there were so many! Still not a problem to us but the food was not good. I had the pigeon which was very overcooked and tough, my husband had the chicken terrine which was bland. Main course was red mullet fillet again overcooked and dry, my husband had the stack burger with enormous very greasy onion rings - pretty unappetising. Suffice to say we will not be booking our family meal there. A great shame. 
-4	 Just got back from a meal at miso. Food fairly average and acceptable but the accompanying restaurant music was most certainly NOT. We were subjected to the owners personal choice of rap music consisting of offensive phrases as 'shut the f***up' repeated over and over again as well as the same track being liberally peppered with the unacceptable 'N' word for black people. We made our disgust known to the waitress who then told the owners who didn't take the music off just skipped over that track! The music certainly did not express any of the culture of Japan or Korea it was just offensive racist sexist rap rubbish....... Not suitable for a public place and have no intention of patronising such support for racism. 
-4	 Starters were ok but the mains were poor. Dreadfully expensive for what is delivered. Coffee was cold and the milk ''separated'' when put into the coffee. The rude waitress TOLD us that this was NOT supermarket milk and that ''it was good for you''. We used to go a lot when in was Demuths but never never again as this was our 3rd 'try' at this restaurant. Not fine dinning but fine dinning prices and very rude staff. She was rude on each visit we have made, rather scruffy which when serving food is not nice. If you want a good vegetarian food you need to go to Terre a Terre Brighton. 
-4	 My husband and I and our two children had a carvery today and left after paying £36.00 and feeling very disappointed. Apparently according to their menu you are only allowed one Yorkshire pudding if you have a piece of beef otherwise you are not allowed one. And only with the beef you are only allowed one and no more. However the chef did let the children have more than one after telling me they are not allowed and making it feel so ackward. The meal wasn't particularly hot. The meat was more fat than meat, my 4 year old was given one piece of pork that was solely fat and again I had to go up and ask for another piece which was ackward. I gave the staff chance to put matters right but unfortunately other than quoting their menu nothing was done. We had our wedding reception here 8years ago and it was lovely they have obviously let their standards slip. My advice is to visit the winchelsea lodge for a carvery where you are sure to be looked after and other than the meat nothing is unlimited as a carvery should be. 
-4	 My goodness! There was nothing fancy about our order! There were three of us ordered a main course only. Drinks came aling fine but after 1 hour we knew, despite the staff's reassurance, we had been forgotten! Eventually the food arrived - cold, soggy chips and a cold burger! Honestly, a child could cook this better! Very, very disappointing and will NEVER visit here again! Thank goodness Il Divo &quot;A Musical Affair&quot; cheered us up! 1 out of 10 for TGI Friday's at the O2 
-4	 I have just spent the weekend on the Isles of Scilly and on the Friday evening went to the Scillonian Club for a drink and some food which I have done on many previous visits. I appreciate that this weekend the Islands were hosting the World Pilot Gig Championships so the club only provided a buffet. The food was inedible, I purchased a bottle of Pinot Grigio which cost £14 and this was undrinkable, tasted like vinegar. My comments regarding This was just brushed aside by staff. I will never eat or drink there again. Worse ever 
-4	 Went on Thursday evening 28/07/2016 at 7pm.   Car park half full as was restaurant and bar almost empty.  We was told we had a 30 minute wait just for a table for us 3, yet we could see over 20 empty tables!   Even with bookings I cannot see how all those tables were going to get full especially given the bar area where we were told to wait was empty except for a couple and a party of 4.  As I had read poor reviews about wait times since the refurbishment, I persuaded my husband & 85 yr old Mum that if it's 30 minutes for a table when there are many empty, it doesn't bode well for food wait time so we should go elsewhere.  Mum was reluctant as it use to be our favourite place to eat. Before this refurbishment and change to a Chef & Brewer, we were regular customers who ate most weeks there.  But after wasting our time and petrol driving from Norbreck out to Thornton and not being able to get a meal we will not be going back ever again! 
-4	 as we had not a good experience last time we visited we thought we would give it another go as now there is dishes from around the world we sat down and after a few minutes went to get our food on returning to our table behind us a guy was washing the floor and it was clear from the smell he was useing bleach and as i have worked in catering you are not surposed to use blech in areas people use so then he came round spraying air freshner which smelled of flowers so all our plates of food tasted of air freshner we was discusted my daughter went to complain and they just said we will open all the doors well im sorry our food had been ruined by then we will never go there again and a place like wing wah should no better 
-4	 We were so hungry coming from Exeter....and thought we will have a nice meal at the Red Deer. I was so disappointed to think a restaurant can serve a poor meal like that. It was utterly disgusting and will never ever go back or advise any one to go there. The presentation was poor, everything was cold, old and stale! It needs a drastic change otherwise the business will go down the drain. 
-4	 Me and my friend walked up here during the Easter hols. It was newly referbed/opened and looked lovely. We wanted lunch but were informed they weren't doing food until the following week. We stayed for a drink and then moved on to find somewhere else to eat. So yesterday we decided to give it another go. Yet again we walked up to see a sign outside clearly saying open but the door was closed and locked. We moved on and had lunch elsewhere. Don't think we will bother trying again. 
-4	 The very worst fish and chips I have ever experienced. One mouthful in and discovered the fish was slimy and uncooked and the batter was bright yellow and gooey with gritty bits in. The service matched. It also stank of filthy old oil. Disgusting in every way. 
-4	 We were a bit reluctant to eat here on this occasion because every time we have dined previously since it opened (5 times) we have had a bad experience from burnt food, watching other people get there orders first who arrived well after we did, to on the last 3 occasions the waitress thinking they are clever by not writing down our order and getting it wrong every time BUT it had been a while and thought we'd chance it coz we love the food.   The new waitress who was lovely put me at ease when she got her order pad so no problem there but the problem was of the noticeable 20% decrease of the portion size! We had garlic bread each which we starred at for a while because not only was it small in size it hadn't risen very well. We shared a tomato & mozzarella salad which had 5 slices of tomato & 4 slices of mozzarella (these were very thinly sliced and small in circumference.) The pizzas usually slightly overlap the plate but now have approx 1.5cm of plate showing around the edge. The toppings were extremely sparse and uneven. On one side there was a good chunk of plain bread with nothing on at all! I asked for onions and literally got 8 thin slivers.  I have never written a review before but I love Pizza Express and I am sooooo disappointed. We have dined in quite a few Pizza Expresses over the years as we don’t have one where we live so include it when we go out of town shopping etc. My favourite is in Salisbury just so you know. 
-4	 So after bowling at guildford spectrum, me and my family decided to go to TGI Fridays, phoned up to ask for a table of 9 for 8pm which they said was no problem. We all got there on time and we were sat promptly to our table. After about 20 minutes we had our drinks order and food order taken. Now we didn't mind the wait 20 minutes for our order to be taken because at this time there were quite a few big tables like us in the restaurant.   After another 10 minutes our drinks arrived, but not all at once, scattered and some drinks seemed to have been forgotten at the last moment. Then we ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our starters, during this time the first starter had to be cancelled as they had unfortunately run out of the bread they normally used, which happens (sometimes you just run out of things) so instead of holding everyone else up, they declined another starter, then a family member wanted to ask about her starter as in the menu it said they used the same bread, but our waiter walked off after she asked.  Then waiting another 20/30 minutes for our starters, during this time most of the bigger tabbies had left. We finally had to get up and ask where our starters were, to which our waiter then came over and said they couldn't bring them out cause they didn't have bread, so then she had to decline her starter, by this time we were all very hungry. What annoyed us was he never said anything before hand so we had to wait longer. Our starters finally appeared and some of us tucked in.  After we were finished, they cleared our starters, by this time it was 9 o'clock so been a good hour, then we ended up waiting another half hour to which different employees brought us the wrong food for different tables, as due to no fault of their own, they didnt know the table numbers so well. When we finally got out main meals, it was again scattered about and had to wait about 5 minutes till everyone had the correct food.   After the food was served, no one checked back on the table to ask if we wanted more drinks etc, then about a quarter of the way in, one of us found a hair in out melted cheese! We again had to get up and find someone as our waiter had seemed to have disappeared. So after finding our waiter, she showed him the hair and instead of apologising he just said 'yes, I see it. Would you like anything else' but this time we'd all had enough. So not having anything else she ate some chips of our plates. During all this time, we had been looking for a manager type to speak too but couldn't seem to tell who was who title wise.  After we had all finished, a manager came over to speak to us, to which she promptly apologised a lot for the poor service, and half our bill for us.   Obviously we didn't expect silver service, but us all being in or have worked in the hospitality industry expected some decent service. The food that didn't have hair in was not bad. Unfortunately will not be going back again. 
-4	 Booked Sunday lunch here today because it used to have the most fantastic carvery and I wanted a nice meal out for my daughter and other kids. I knew there was a big problem before we even went in as the car park and surrounding street which used to be completely full was ominously empty. Needless to say, so was the pub. The staff know you're going to be disappointed, they looked uncomfortable and slightly shifty, even though it was very quiet we were given a very average table and it took a while for them to take our order. They didn't explain the menu and I got the impression they didn't want you to ask too many questions about it. To cut a boring story short, we ordered beef sunday roast, not cheap at £14.95 a head, the same price as the chi chi Vineyard up the road which is very good and has attentive service, good wine list and the best olives for miles around. It was luke warm, bisto gravey, potatoes like rocks, the yorkshire was small heavy and undercooked yet somehow burnt on the bottom. The cabbage was overcooked, and there was a minimal sniff of cheese sauce on the cauliflower, one bite of over cooked carrot and parsnip hidden somewhere on the plate. They didn't even offer any sauces, condiments or napkins. The beef itself was quite nice, but the fact that all the men in the group had food left on the their plates at the end said it all. &quot;Do yer want a pudding?&quot; asked the poor teenage waitress aimlessly, not quite coming within touching distance of the table and clearly not expecting a positive response. The pudding menu was only made up of about 4 items including crumble and bread and butter pudding presumably made of all the old stale crap they can't get rid of. Feeling somewhat downcast we politely declined. &quot;Did you enjoy your meal&quot; I was asked at the end of a miserable hour in this pub &quot;Not really, it wasn't very good&quot; I said handing over more than £100 for the pleasure of feeding 5 adults and 1 child, no starters, puddings and 1 soft drink each. &quot;Oh dear&quot; said the barman as he swiftly swiped my card. Don't bother going here, quite frankly it's rubbish which is why the car park is now empty. They'll have to try and lot lot harder if they want to survive in this competitive area. Try the Old Vine, the Bull or the lovely Middle House instead. 
-4	 This restaurant was a great disappointment to us. We had visited some years ago with friends and our memory was that it was excellent, sadly things appear to have changed: It started with warm champagne and two hours later finished with cold espresso, what went on in between was no better.  The food looked good but didn't eat well. The service was friendly but clunky and awkward. The tables were far too close together. The building appeared to have been over extended and had very little character the atmosphere was poor. The decor was neither modern cutting edge or old and characterful. The only part that felt like a Michelin star restaurant was when the bill came. This is a great shame as so many people must visit this Michelin star restaurant on very special occasions.   
-4	 A large group of us visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday and we were expecting a lovely meal. Our drinks orders came sporadically, some forgotten and some arrived that weren't even ordered for our table. When the food arrived, three of the pizzas were forgotten about and were obviously rushed and finally arrived with raw bases. We sent them back and arrived back pretty much in the same state. We then ordered desserts which came 10 minutes apart. The food overall was pretty tasteless and my chicken and mushroom risotto had two or three tiny bits of chicken.  When complaining to the manager, he didn't even apologise and simply said we should of pre-ordered our food. However, we were NEVER given this option even when booking they were aware of our table size. He was rude and ignorant.  We did receive a discount on our bill however, we all felt this didn't justify the quality of food, drinks and service we received.   Will not be visiting again or recommending because I could probably do a better job at home. 
-4	 Been to this pub many times but not over the last months and wished we had not bothered or at least looked at the latest reviews. Tuesday lunch so not expected the pub to be completely booked but very surprised to find so few tables occupied. All became clear soon enough.  Having had to wait a considerable time to order or meal and even longer for the first course to arrive, again another long wait for the main course.... looking at the drinks ordered standing on the bar getting nicely luke warm but no one bothered to bring them to our table. Having to watch the three male waiting/bar staff having mock fisty fights behind the bar, touching each other up! One swirling his key/fob at infinitum around his fingers (me hoping it would hit him somewhere it would hurt or at least break a few glasses). For goodness sake lads you are in a public area supposedly to serve clients! Please keep you hands of each other and please stop running your hands through your hair and beards after all you are handling glasses and plates we are supposed to drink out and eat off! Totally disgusting.  The food was hit and miss. Pate was bought in so no complaints. My husbands mixed seafood sandwich was fine, scampi and chips with mushy peas was not too good. Mushy peas were cold, chips over cooked and scampi about edible. Apple pie with custard was OK.   One hour later whilst I am writing this suffering from bad indigestion food or experience I do not care to dwell on suffice to say we will not be visiting this venue again until it changes management, retrains or changes the staff and gets some good reviews on Trip Advisor.  During the three hours we were there only one table got cleaned..... you guessed it too busy preening themselves and rearranging their hair styles and facial growth. Yuk!! 
-4	 The pub is very welcoming nice friendly staff who also allowed us into the bar with our dog. We ordered 2 fish n chip dinners for £15 as recommended on the black board in the entrance. I requested to substitute chips for new potatoes which I have done in numerous pubs and restaurants (for dietary reasons) to which they opliged . I was horrified when paying the bill as a result of this small change they decided to charge us double as a result the meals cost £30!!!! What a rip off DONT BE FOOLED 
-4	Absolutely discusting,, had the runs for hours.. No taste to food.. Never going back there.. I'm fuming what they charged.. Should provide me with toilet roll..  But staff are lovely and friendly..
-4	 Where to start ... Sardine fritter was greasy as were the garlic mushrooms. Both main courses were a disaster - uncooked pizza and burnt seafood 'crepes'. Not sure where the crepes were and as for the seafood it was almost non existent. I found one tiny hard scallop and 4 pieces of something rubbery (presumably squid??) in a dish of gloopy tomato and cheese. We could eat our main courses and did complain to the 'chef' but he just walked away without responding. Absolutely terrible attitude.   The only positive we could find was that the cheese topped garlic bread was delicious. My recommendation would be to go round the corner into Chinatown and steer well clear of Ciao Bella. 
-4	My daughters book a Mother's Day high tea we got a chipped milk jug and a big dirty plastic tea pot sandwiches really cold not sure if bread was frozen scones had been microwaved cake was ok jam ok but very weird we got a big dish of clotted cream enough for half a dozen scones not very impressed
-4	 I've been to the William several times over the last few years and have always found it good value for money for good food. This time a group of ordered the William burger. It took an hour to arrive and was really dried out, I'd go as far as to say cremated. Also the fat, juicy burgers they used to serve have been replaced with thin, value, polystyrene burgers. The one saving grace is that the staff were very pleasant and apologetic. I won't be eating here again. 
-4	Arrived at the Red Lion today with 7 family members plus my baby to celebrate Mother's Day....extra special event with it being my first! My husband rang three times in the lead up to the day for various things I.e menu information amd each time quoted our name. The last call being Friday! At no point were we told we didn't have a booking but upon arrival this is what we were told. We were shown to a table as they decided it could have been booked under a wrong name, we were asked for a drinks order and then 5mins later told we had to move as the family whose table we were at had arrived and &quot;they recognised them&quot; so we had to leave as nowhere else was available. The waitress literally told us and ran off without even attempting to accommodate us or make the situation better. My husband tried to speak to staff and was basically called a liar, on leaving I actually saw the waitress in question whispering with another member of staff. Very helpful indeed when you have a disappointed family being sent away at 2pm on Mother's Day with a 9 month old baby in a pram being humped up and down stairs. She shyly said sorry on our way past but I couldn't help but ask why she thought we would lie about a reservation on a key date such as this. At this point a male member of staff was quick to get involved telling us it wasn't there fault. It was amusing that the staff seemed to be shocked that we were so upset by the situation. Mistakes happen, somebody couldn't follow the simple task of writing a booking down which is fair enough but what was so shocking was the complete disregard and the lack of effort made to try and rectify the situation. Then to blame us!!!!! Perhaps if the male waiter put as much passion into serving customers as he did arguing with them the reviews on here would improve! I quite honestly think he was enjoying the whole confrontation, each time we went to leave he said something else in an attempt to provoke some very upset customers. We did ask to speak to a Manager but they were unavailable! I'd be interested to see what the Manager thought of his staffs shockingly embarrassing people and service skills. No idea why anyone would go here when 5 minutes down the road you have a much better standard of pub in the Lambton Worm. Thankfully we reverted back to last years option who kindly fitted us in. Will never go back and would not advise anyone else to, especially if it's an important event and they may not &quot;recognise your face&quot;.
-4	 Totally overpriced and poor quality food - Beef bourguignon was £14.95 and was basically a bowl of tasteless stew - with 2 new potatoes a few carrots and untrimmed green beans. Starter of scallops was totally ruined with the amount of vinaigrette on the meagre salad - topped with 3 small scallops - again charged £8.95. The service was terrible and we were sat in a draught all night as the door kept being left open - and we had to shut it as not one of the staff even noticed. Never again - will be giving this a wide berth from now on 
-4	 Came here with my friend it was our first visit the woman at the bar was very rude was talking to her friends when she was supposed to be serving us, when I was speaking she would turn to speak to her friend very unprofessional. My friend got a breakfast the beans were cold and our meals didn't come out together . overall the food was poor quality, staff was rude, only good thing was the layout of the building was very nice. Won't be eating here again. 
-4	 Food was just a disaster: small portions and pasta overcooked and too salty. Service was ok but food very bad 
-4	 Even though I had booked I had to wait 1 hr for my main course to arrive, which is far to long when you have a toddler. The resturant was only half full and the manager told me it was because he had take away pizzas and that the ovens could only take 12 pizzas. He also said he would have to take money off most people's meal if mine was considered an exceptional situation. I think they should run the resturant better, if someone waits 1hr for the main course to arrive then act respectfully and take 10% off. 
-4	 Please be warned, we have had a takeaway meal tonight. It was nothing at all like before this Restaurant has changed hands and the Bon O Phool Special Biryani was just like a very poor special fried rice from a low grade chinese takaway, Juber has gone and it was dreadful we are very very disappointed with what we received. Also the Vegetable curry wasn't, it was just like a pureed sauce just awful, this has to be the worst Indian meal I have ever had, in fact that is calling it names because it wasn't very Indian at all. If we had wanted a special fried rice we would have ordered it from Chopstix! and I know it would have been much better than this poor excuse for a Biryani. I have tellephoned to speak with the manager and he has offered our next Biryani on the house but to be honest we really wouldnt want to experience anything like this again so will not be returning even for free, such a shame after all these years and also after Juber had returned to bring this restaurant back to the old days, i am afraid that those days gave well and truly gone. 
-4	 The food here used to be excellent, however on the last two occasions we have had takeaways from here the food has been really greasy and the batter on the king prawn balls was really thick and stodgy. I think there has been a change of ownership, and it has definitely gone downhill. 
-4	 We will never ever eat in this place again, in fact it was so awful we never eat it and left. we ordered Fish, chips and Peas, it came with NO peas and the FISH was so OVERCOOKED - GREASY- TASTED DISGUSTING and to top it off they were FROZEN chips. We have never eaten such poor disgusting food and would never recommend this to anyone AWFUL place 
-4	We came here for a family celebration as had been here before, we ordered drinks and waited 15 minutes for these, then once we had ordered our food which was a set menu we then waited 1/2 hour for the starters to arrive and then another 15 minutes for the soup course and then over 1 1/2 hour for the mains to arrive which we had to chase more than once, then when the dishes finally arrived the food was warm not hot. The service was appalling we were missing 2 dishes which we had to ask for twice,, Then when we had finished our table was left uncleared for over 20 minutes and we had to ask them to clear it ! Then we had to take the dirty table cloth off our table which they should have done before our dessert arrived which took another 25 minutes and we sent it away, and took it to the owner who was totally not interested in what was happening in his restaurant and never apologised for the service we told him to take the service charge off and we were not the only dissatisfied customers in the restaurant !!!!!! My father in law was treating us to a lovely family meal which turned into a disaster would never ever recommend this place to anyone !!!!!
-4	 Went to gapton pizza hut today it was an absolute disgrace! First we was stood at the desk for ten minutes waiting for a member of staff to taken us to a table. We then ordered our food 4 pizzas they only made 3! We had to complain that the forth pizza was missing! Then we find a thick layer of hairs all under the cheese on one of the pizzas so we had to complain yet again the waitress looked so embarrassed as she returned it to get us a new pizza, while we waited our glasses were bought over for our drinks which we're not even clean they had smudges all over them! We then got our forgotten pizza and the replacement one and were having to sit checking for hairs! When you go for a meal you want to relax not sit checking your food hasn't got half a beard in it! So food was ok till dessert when we get told we can't have ice cream as they have none! Was such a disappointing trip. Then the poor waitress come out who by this time has had enough of us with all our problems and she had managed to get the manager to knock 17 pound off our bill! I'm not one to moan ever! But you pay enough decent hard earned money you want some decent food not beard pizza and Grimy glasses forgotten pizzas! Thanks to the waitress though she tried her hardest. Won't be returning though! 
-4	 Was looking forward to Sunday lunch out. When arrived, told only one roast on offer. Ordered fish and chips and roast between us - chips still hard in middle, fish dry, and as for the roast . . . Inedible. Good points - coke was fizzy and came with curly straw... although we had to remind them to bring us our drinks. 
-4	 Yet again another awful meal smothered chicken . Bland food dry chips bacon was a grey colour hardly resembled bacon nothing nice about the meal. Funny thing is we only went as we complained about our last meal and had a voucher won't be going back for food again! 
-4	 Today the 25th June 2016 we went here for my Mums bday. We haven't tried Loch Fyne before and had good expectations and came away disappointed.   My father and I had mussels which came out lukewarm and without bread. We had to start without the rest of our table, there was 6 of us. My grandfather and brother shared a basket of bread but then the waitress forgot my mothers prawn cocktail. After beckoning the waitress countless times we finally got bread, the prawn cocktail and extra plates.   After this we waited quite a time for our mains. Everyone's was fine except mine. I will tell you now my seafood pasta was terrible. Tough squid and gritty prawns which I refused to eat and disgarded. One of the mussels in the bowl was not at all cooked, also disgarded. I ended up with a bowl still full of spaghetti which I didn't eat as I was dissatisfied. For a seafood restaurant this is terrible. You should properly cook your seafood.   After the mains were cleared away we were given the bill. However we waited at least 20 minutes before someone came to collect the payment. This experience has ruined my mums special day. Will not be returning. 
-4	 Oh! How I wished I'd read the previous reviews before I stopped there on the way back from our holiday. I completely agree with all the previous reviewers. The service we received was terrible. One server, sadly not the one who looked after us, seemed energetic and helpful but ours was lethargic, totally disinterested and muttered his questions to us without eye-contact or even a hint of a smile. I have never waited so long for a burger! (it wasn't even nice when I got it). My husband had chicken nuggets and they were dry and tasteless. This was a complete contrast to the Burger King at the Eurotunnel Terminal- this was excellent.  Please, Burger King, do something to improve the Toddington Branch- it does nothing to help your reputation!. 
-4	 My partner and I went to The Cornish Arms expecting a really nice, quiet, romantic meal. What we got could not have been further from that. I'm not really sure where to start, so I may as well just list all of the 'experiences' we were subjected to.   The food (2 starters and 2 mains) was absolutely not worth the £50 price tag, it was very average - it is probably worth mentioning that we overheard another couple complaining at length to staff about the quality of their meal.  Because there were patrons seated outside we had to put up with a door slamming (quite literally slamming) every 30 seconds as people came in and out. I actually developed a nervous tick as I was sat just waiting for the next slam.  The atmosphere is basically that of a 'wacky warehouse'. You find a table after picking up a menu from the bar. You queue up at the bar to order your food and drinks. The bulk of your fellow patrons is made up loud young families and their pets, with exception of the few other shell shocked couples with whom you keep exchanging sympathetic looks.  If you're looking for a romantic meal for two, or just a nice meal for the family, I would keep looking. If it once did deserve it's reputation, it certainly doesn't now. 
-4	 For the first time ever I thought I would order a take away. I chose 3 southern fried chicken pieces and garlic and cheese mushrooms. I paid the exact amount stated on my order to be called by a very surly girl stating we are very busy your order will be an hour and we need another £2 for delivery. I stated I had paid the amount on the bill and was told if I didn't pay I wouldn't get my order as the driver would refuse to come. I cancelled the Mushrooms at £2.50 to cover this. One hour later the most disgusting grease ridden brown in colour chicken and chips arrived. This was so bad I couldn't even give it to the dogs. I called complained to once again recieve attitude. Enviromental health will be called in the morning as I have never seen chicken that colour before. Disgusting food disgusting service!!!! 
-4	 Call the is a top restaurant? Deary me, for those that know food and have high expectations when high bills will be given to you at the end of the night, then stop right now.  Only a monkey could have been working that night in the kitchen to have served up such a basic and non fresh offering.  This place has become arrogant riding off the some good review a few years ago and now it acts as if it is Conrans.  This place is a joke 
-4	 Ordered a jacket potato with beans and cheese for lunch. Arrived and had a small spoonful of beans. Took it to bar and asked for a full portion like my sister had got. Staff member rude and did not apologise just took my plate. Food brought back to me but didn't look as though as more beans but couldn't be bothered to complain again as I knew that the staff weren't interested. Started to eat jacket potato and it was hard and disgusting. Left it and did not eat it. Sister's jacket potato was also hard and she left the majority of hers. Mum had a toasted sandwich which was coated in oil. Will never eat here again. Couldn't even make simple meals well. Food was disgusting and staff rude and uninterested. 
-4	 We can't believe this is owned by the same people as The Parlour, it's a very poor relation! The service was virtually non existent. We had to ask the people at the next table if we could use their menu as, although we'd been sat for some while, we still hadn't been given one by a member of staff.  The food, when it arrived, was bland, dry and not appetising at all. No question was asked with regards to the food left on our plates (over half of my husbands) and then after asking for the bill three times, it still didn't materialise. They should think themselves lucky my husband went inside to pay as we were fed up of waiting, I'm sure many would've just walked off in disgust. We definitely won't be going again and if asked by friends and family, would discourage them from going aswell. 
-4	 What was planned as a lovely Family Christmas Dinner was a total, expensive sham. I should have known there would be problems when after paying the full amount of our booking, and giving the menu options to the person who took all the money, I was emailed a couple of days later requesting my food options. I attempted to ring the person 3 times and was told each time that she was busy and would ring me back. She did not. On the 4th time that I rang, the man who answered the phone told me not to worry as they had got our menu options and it was all sorted. I had booked the later sitting as some of the party had a fair way to travel. We arrived at the Pear Tree before the 3pm sitting. I gave in our name and we ordered drinks whilst the young man went off to sort our table. When he came back, he informed me that they had no record of my booking and asked me if I was sure that I had booked there and not at the Three Pears down the road!!!!!!! I was not impressed to say the least. Mega panic was setting in by this time, as I was not quite sure what we were going to do at 3.20pm on Christmas afternoon. Thank goodness for modern mobile phones as my daughter was able to get my emails on her phone and show them the confirmation booking email. They disappeared off again and after a little while came back and stated that there were able to sort out a table. We had to choose our menu options again and fortunately were able to have the food that we required. We were eventually taken to a table after 4pm. We were sat in the room were the early sitting had been so as we were just starting, they were leaving and the staff were clearing the tables and setting up ready for Boxing Day, so this made us feel like we should not have been there. The food was lovely and well presented so I can not complain about that. It was just the whole experience was awful. It had cost us a lot of money. I am just glad that I had not booked a wedding or a larger function to find when I got there, there was not record of a booking. One of the waitresses spilt a drink down my daughter's back and another one spilled sorbet into my handbag, so all in all I am not very happy and very disappointed. The manager on duty stated that the girl who had arranged the booking was not on duty so they were going to phone her at home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was obviously the elusive one who was never around when I phoned or phoned me back. Totally an awful experience 
-4	 entered this resturant and was greated by a friendly waiter who showed us to our seats and it went down hill from there, we had our menu's thrown at us by a disgruntled waiter who was really rude when taking our order. When our meals came out, our plates where thrown down infront of us ( i ordered a vinderloo and it tasted like a korma, not hot at all, and the midrass was a sloppy mess ) we did not complain, we said thank you for our meal and again the disgruntaled waiter didnt thank us, give us eye contact, he was just plain rude and snatched the bill and walked off. 
-4	It took ages to be able to put in an order for food or drink. After a long wait for our food then to arrive, our burgers and salad came without the chips they were meant to, when we asked about this, they said the chips were on their way. 20 minutes later, after we had eaten our burgers, we asked again, they had clearly forgotten about our chips. Another 20 minutes later, our chips finally arrived, with no apologies, just sarcastic comments from the manager placing the blame on his employees. Once we got the bill, the manager took our money and then went and had a phone call outside rather than getting us our change and then blamed this on other staff using the till.  The food was nice, but ruined by the extremely poor service. It seems that all the problems we faced during this meal were due to poor management, yet the blame was continuously passed onto the other hard working staff of the restaurant.
-4	 Went to the restaurant for tea and cakes. Ignored by staff although the place was empty. We had the afternoon tea. The scones were toasted ! Very unusual. Was this using up stale ones? Service was appalling. We had to ask for the bill twice and were given the wrong bill three times. 
-4	There really is nothing positive to say about this place. We booked a table for 12 one month in advance, so they were aware it was reasonable size party of people (family who can't often all get together). Well, the food took an hour and 15 mins after ordering and delivery was staggered so we di not eat together. Some meals were cold, mother-in-laws steak was so thought it had to be taken away & another cooked - which wasn't much better. There was food missing form some orders - I could go on, th list is endless. I did complain and the best they could offer was a £40 voucher, to be used in one of their restaurants - not a chance we'd eat there again. And how do you split £40 between 12 people who rarely meet up together? Seriously - go somewhere els.
-4	 Visited on a Groupon. Not even worth the £5.50 we paid.  Cold, dried out food which looks like it had been there for days. Labelling incorrect... &quot;chicken balls&quot; tasted like tinned meatballs in gravy. Non of the selection advertised on the website is available.   Please stay away from this place, pay the extra cost & go to cosmos or emperor. 
-4	This place never gets any better! Stay away. Service is almost non existent. They ruined our family Christmas meal and after a second chance it had not improved. I have only given 1 star because you can't give them 0.
-4	 well been there a few times and after my visit last nite i wont be going back. i went to the bar got an over priced pint tryed to order some food i had a very rude northener saying that he couldnt swap peas for salad then had to ask the chef and said it mucks up stock levels they have done this many times before wot a joke then tryied to order something for my girlfriend and not in stock so we gave up!!!!!! my friends ate but it was ment to be a rib eye steak but was defo a rump to sum it up spend a few quid more and go else where 
-4	 Visited here one evening. What a big mistake. I had a chicken dish and my husband had a fish dish. I think it was tilapia. Mine was edible but my husband couldn't eat his it was so awful. When we were asked if everything was OK with the food the waiter was disappointed we didn't like the fish and offered a salmon dish instead. He was very apologetic but then admitted that he doesn't like the fish curry either!  Of course I'd finished my food by the time his arrived so that wasn't ideal.  By way of compensation we were given a voucher for 5% discount on our next visit. We live locally and received a 5% voucher with our local paper a week or so later. I wasn't very impressed and will definitely not be going back. 
-4	 ....than this from a pub chain. Okay, fair enough the inside of this pub looks good after the refurb. However, from the outside it looks like a dogs dinner. They have moved the entrance to get more seats inside and put a stupid roof in a weird place. The new orangery from the outside also looks awkward. Get beyond this and we get to the food - I saw the ad for the Head Chef - around minimum wage which, with due respect, is reflected in the quality of the food - dire, prawn and crayfish starter with no taste, chicken main like rubbery plastic. Hydes can't hide behind teething problems, they have enough pubs to get it right first time. Also I note on Facebook they have quite a few 5 star reviews - it's a shame they are all from The Hornsmill staff or Hydes staff, this is cheap marketing. This pub has always been a white elephant, I do hope after purchasing the property and spending hundreds of thousands on a refurb that Hydes know what they have taken on, however I suspect not. Being a local I can say if they are hoping to take, as stated, £20,000 a week, they have seriously missed the mark - we locals want VFM, good food at low prices and outsiders won't travel to Helsby as they have this distorted image of our village which Hydes won't be able to change. Shame. 
-4	 I have joined Trip advisor today just to write this review. I was apauled with the service that my fellow diner and I received this evening.  My boyfriend is very well traveled and always makes excuses for others behaviour or poor service that he receives but this evening he decided to stand up for himself and complain that his food was not what he ordered. The chef came out and argued that the food was perfect and would not back down. He then just walked off without offering a reasonable resolution. Very strange behaviour. We noticed another couple were also complaining about the food quality. I don't think they got any sympathy either.my food was however what I ordered though not at all remarkable. 
-4	Really disappointed in the food I've just picked up from here, if I hadn't been up since 6am I'd have taken it back! Chips were inedible, blatantly double fried, used to be really good food from here! Won't be coming back!
-4	 After a lovely day in London seeing a show, dinner at The Ivy, after dinner drinks at the Waldolf Hilton for my sons 18th Birthday with family we decided to stop off at The Savoy to have a night cap. We was extremely disappointed with the service we received we attempted to go into the American Bar and after we informed them we was not guests we was told no tables were available we tried the other bar near the restaurant to be told the same :(( we asked if we could have a drink in the lounge area which was deserted and was told to check with the lady whether there was a table available!! eventually got seated ordered our drinks (two gin and Ts, one southern comfort, one beer and frothy coffee to a waiter with attitude making us feel we was not welcome (let me add that we was all sober, smartly dressed and a family not a group). After a long wait the waiter said they was having trouble locating Southern Comfort in the hotel so we chose Vodka and Coke instead. After another wait drinks arrived minus the coke and coffee, eventually coffee arrived not the one ordered informed waiter of wrong coffee to actually get a tut from him, we then asked to see the manager as we was not happy with the service and attitude of staff we was receiving, never got to see the manager but was informed we would not be charged for our drinks and was eventually apologised to somewhat reluctantly. We will never venture in The Savoy again which is a shame as the building is stunning but the welcome was not. We might not be rich and famous but our hard earned money should have been welcomed and we should not have been made to feel not welcome shame on you The Savoy. 
-4	 We had booked to come for Boxing day. A table of 15, we had pre ordered our food and also pre ordered drinks for the table. Our table was booked for 16:45 - we arrived at 16:30 so we could meet all in the party have a quick drink and then be seated. When we went to be seated we are advised our table was not ready, we were finally seated at 17:15 with no apology.   When we go to the table our pre ordered wine was not on the table and we had to remind the waitress.. We were then advised that they had run out of pate - now under normal circumstances I would not be put out by this but 8 of us had pre ordered this. Having worked in the catering trade, when this is pre ordered surely the chef should know to order enough???? The other choices were not to every ones taste and only 4 of us had an alternative - when we asked for this to be removed from the bill we were met with a very stroppy waitress who did not understand why we didn't want to pay for this (it was a set menu / price) and said all she could do was apologise. Finally we were seen by someone with a little more common-sense and we were told that the people who did not have starters would not be charged for that part of the meal. We all then went to the carvery for the main meal. Firstly the meal all looked over cooked and dry and not very well carved either. My daughter had the turkey and I asked for a sausage as well, the chef rolled his eyes at me and with utter disgust on his face put one on. The veg was the usual under cooked and dry. I had the turkey and beef and was not allowed a sausage, apparently they are £1.50 extra????? My neice had the beef and almost broke her teeth and chocked on a bone found in her meat, the waitress was not concered by this?! I could not eat the beef it was over cooked and ruined, the turkey was dry and the veg was not very nice at all. The chef explained the beef was a rib ............ I don't think so!  The only saving grace was the desert. You can not really go wrong with Mr Whippy ice cream and terry orange pieces. The 1 star mark was for dessert only.  This was supposed to be a lovely family get together to celebrate Christmas and getting every one together. The amount people did not eat was wasteful due to poor quality and cooking.   The staff were appalling apart from the one waitress who seemed to understand our feelings, I am sorry I didn't get her name but she is wasted in this establishment.  All in all the experience was not great, the service was bad and the food was not worth serving.  &quot;home of the roast&quot; I think not. 
-2	 Was second time my friends & I have visited this restaurant & unfortunately this time we were pretty disappointed.   The restaurant mixed up the booking but we're still able to accommodate us.  The karaoke machine was not very user friendly & we spent more time trying to work out the song choices than actually singing!!   Food was ok but not something I would necessarily want to have again!  Had a good night overall but honestly don't think we will be back again! 
-2	 Decided to come to Prezzo with some friends for my birthday & have to admit I was pretty let down by the service. The waitresses were very slow & rude & definitely needed some customer service training. We also found it very strange when we received the bill that an additional service charge of £19 had been added, which we decided not to pay as we didn't feel the service was worthy of a tip. On a positive note everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food & was impressed with that part. 
-2	We wanted to get back home experience so decided to go there! We initially went to the pay point but sat waiting for someone to take our order and none came for 15 minutes! The bhajias were very salty and the chutneys were watery with that ready made export quality artificial test!One piece if rasmalai costed us same as a pack of 3 from asda! The price were extremely high based on previous footfall! The only thing we liked was special Faluda! They should reduce price! If want to keep the same then increase the quality of service, at least should place a menu card on tables!
-2	 I really thought we'd be on to a winner here, having Googled the menu beforehand, as the pub looks lovely and cosy when you first walk in and the staff were welcoming. However the slow service and lousy food were a real letdown. The place seemed quite seriously under-staffed for a Saturday lunchtime, and even with this we felt particularly neglected as some of the larger parties were given more attention (e.g. we weren't even told what the specials were!).  Ordered a latte as we were treating this meal as brunch, it took about half an hour to appear and as I saw it being made I found out why it was the worst 'latte' I've ever had - it was made with two thirds (cold) black coffee (topped up with hot milk)!! Serving that in a glass does not make it a latte!!! After all that time the waitress seemed surprised we were actually ready to order food and had to go back for her notepad. I had a cold bacon, brie & cranberry sandwich (heavy on the cranberry, light on the bacon) on slightly stale bread and my Mum went for an omelette that looked more like a pancake, and we had another huge wait before the food arrived. Everything was disappointing but just not quite bad enough to complain about.  It's probably not a bad place to pop into for a pint if you're in the area, but as a restaurant I would certainly rate it as poor and will not be eating here again. 
-2	 We went for my niece birthday, Lovely friendly staff, very helpful .... I just think it's over priced for the food ... If you love ribs however then it's the place to go 
-2	 We have been to Bill's many times and in many other locations. This was my third visit here and so we are familiar with the menu etc and have a pretty good expectation of what we will get.  We booked here following a show and glad we had as it was as packed as ever.  The staff were really welcoming and accommodating so no complaints at all there. I also enjoy the atmosphere here and think it's really comfortable. The only thing that was a let down was the quality of food.  My son ordered a chicken fillet burger.. it was very overcooked and dry and had gone hard around the edges.. there was no juice or anything moist so when opening up his bun it was just a sad piece of meat in a very dry bun.. luckily he's 6 so with a bit of mayo he made the most of it.  I ordered a sirloin with bearnaise. It was cooked just fine in terms of being medium rare as I had asked however, all I could taste was the chargrilled burnt bits.. I always love a little chargrilled effect but this was overpowering and just not enjoyable at all. I left most of my steak because of this. The bearnnaise was very thick and not overly flavoursome so did little to help matters.  My fries were overcooked and tasted of very well used/ old oil. it's like the fries had been sat in the fryer at the wrong temp for too long so they were pretty horrible too. Lastly my watercress garnish was just a bit shrivelled up on end of the plate, so all in all a bit disappointing.  The waitress was attentative and could see I had left a lot on my plate.. she did enquire if all was OK but with only my 6 year old there I just didn't want to spoil things for him. This was a surprise away weekend in London for him and he was enjoying everything so I just let it go without complaint.. I could see they were very busy too and sometimes it's just not worth kicking up..  This was the first time I have had a poor experience of Bill's though and normally it is very good.      
-2	 the counters of ice cream and cakes look amazing, it was all spoilt when it came to ordering. its the usual experience of English as a second language with the staff. Gave up on the order and did not get a drink with the ice cream. The ice cream was as good as it looks, but I would not go back, I was made to feel like I had the language problem, this was a shame as the menu was fantastic and I would have liked to try other things. 
-2	 been here many times over the past few years, always full of nice atmosphere and ambience, food was always very good but last night, a family get together, very disappointed with the standard of the food, very large choice, maybe that's the problem, I had the steak pie, very rich and hard going, almost tasted of venison , un edible, served with mash that was cold, the others had a reasonable steak plus some having pork loin, tastless im sorry to say. decided to have a dessert as I was still hungry, me having a choc brownie, just fell apart, with powdery stuff inside, my husband had the apple crumble, that was like baby puree, with a runny topping, so we did say something, as we never usually do complain, and in all fairness they deducted something off of the bill, the staff were very friendly and polite, but just felt the whole evening was a let down as we as a family very rarely get together, and being a special birthday treat too, so as it stands I wouldn't recommend for an evening meal, maybe lunchtimes are different? 
-2	 This resturant is getting worse. It used to be much better than it is now. Has a very clattery atmosphere. The salad bar can be good providing staff can be bothered to keep it full. The last meal i ate here was burned and accompanied by a very odd tasting sauce. It is a shame that they got rid of the early bird. There is now a supposed cheaper bit of the menu that is not worth bothering with. You can always manage to get a decent pudding (if you like ice cream). Service is a bit hit and miss. The menu is not great for vegetarians or children but great if you like cheap meat. 
-2	 Starter was too large, main too small, and i had the cheese cake one of my favourite deserts usually but this cheese cake was very thick stodgy just like a cheep shop brought one, couldn't eat it nether could my daughter. Sorry my first bad review 
-2	I visited this tea room with an ex colleague who was on maternity leave. We ordered tea and cake. We were also discussing some future projects and had notepaper each making notes.  The assistant came twice to ask if we wanted anything else, promptly cleared our plates and tea cups as soon as we had finished and brought the bill which made us feel like we had to leave. There was only one other table occupied and so it wasn't as though they needed the table!  We usually meet in Starbucks where we are never rushed and feel we can chat after finishing coffee without having to buy another cup. Starbucks it will be next time.
-2	 we are regular visitors to the Morris dancers, always love the staff & the food - not on this occasion. We arrived with 2 small children, got a table straight away. It took staff 40 minutes to take drinks order & as we'd mentioned no one had taken food order they took that too. Another 40 minutes after 'mentioning' again our starters arrived with drinks - no kids food as promised, plus half starters were missing. We gave up waiting after asking for the third time for our food/drinks. Very, very upset with the Morris dancers tonight! First time we've had to complain about anything before! 
-2	 After my mum had spoken often about how good the Bird in Hand was, I booked a meal as part of her 90th birthday celebration. Although the pub was busy with what looked liked returning customers, I would not rush back. The roast meat (beef and lamb) were in my opinion pre-cooked and not freshly roasted. The meat was not hot, in fact rather barely warm although the veggies seemed to be freshly cooked. It was a huge disappointment. The waitress offered to replace the meals but we opted for a bowl of soup instead. Everyone else appeared to be enjoying their meals so perhaps we were just unlucky. 
-2	 Firstly we were seated and then 5 mins later i get a call saying that we hadn't turned up. I explained we were sitting in the restaurant already. We then was served food and asked for some bread, this was handed to us after asking three times. At the end they also got the bill wrong. I would not recommend. Food is OK but nothing special. Staff are useless. 
-2	 Paid £26 for a meal which was in my opinion barely edible. The kung po chicken was literally chicken in a generic pink sweet sauce which tasted like chemicals. One mouthful from two of us and it was binned. The chicken balls were made of very little chicken pieces, covered in so much batter that the majority of it had to be picked off as it was like bread dough. Incredibly diappointed as have bought from here before with no problem. Wouldn't usually share takeaway reviews on here but was so disappointed with it I thought it only right. Would have said good value for money based on quantity if it tasted good but most of it went in the bin 
-2	Booked a table here last week for after the pantomime at the Swan. First impressions, the place was a bit soulless, not a great atmosphere, the people at other tables looked bored and seemed to have been waiting a long time for food. The waitresses were friendly and polite. They sorted our drinks promptly. They were attentive and we didn't have to keep asking them for things. We did wait a while for the food but understand that it is cooked fresh so we didn't mind. I was a bit disappointed with the meal, tiny pot of chips and a burger on a huge plate, looked lost . The burger itself was lovely, juicy and tender however the bap was dry and cheap tasting and the other things on it weren't really amazing tasting!! Not wowed by the food had better at mcdonalds. When asking to see the dessert menu we were just given a the main menu which had only four desserts on, where are the knickerbocker glories, pancakes etc that you would expect from an American diner? Very disappointed. When I asked the waitress is this it? She just shrugged!, We were not told at all about the specials board. Overall ok for hangover food, they haven't quite got the hang of the American diner experience!!
-2	 My husband and I dined here today for lunch, and we had high hopes having read the chef's blog. Unfortunately we won't be returning in a hurry. First of all the arrival is confusing; no real signage advising which door to use, only arrows to &quot;the snug&quot; or to &quot;the bar&quot;. Well, we wanted the restaurant so which way to go? We were greeted by the Maitre'd who asked if we wanted to go to the bar or straight to our table, opting for the latter we were led through a a series of corridors to the dining room which was dark and totally unispiring (and we were visiting on a bright sunny day) and had a very strange atmosphere. There were a few tables seated already, but the place felt strangely devoid of any &quot;buzz&quot; - only made worse by the fact that there was no background music - which meant that everyone could hear each others conversations and we both found this to be very uncomfortable. This only got better when the restaurant filled up. The lighting is very poor and as the decor is erm..... well, non existent it adds to the drab feeling of the place. So first impressions are not good!  The menu arrived and there were plenty of things on there that we both wanted to try - so things were looking up at last. After a few minutes perusing the menu, the maitre'd came over to take our order and we asked him to clarify a few of the items on there. We had asked for some pork scratchings to be brought out before the starters (bit confusing as they were part of the Starters menu along with some olives - but surely they aren't actually starters??) Annoyingly, they arrived just after our starters with no apology or even acknowledgement that they had arrived late. Having placed our order, we then asked if we could have some drinks (so far, none offered to us as yet). We didn't want any wine, but as the wine list didn't offer any non-alcoholic drinks we had to ask what was available. We (sort of) got suitable drinks, but it really would have been better if they were included on the drinks list.  There are a lot of staff, so business is obviously good, however as it wasn't really busy yet the staff didn't have much to do so were all standing together at the drinks area. This made us feel even more uncomfortable!!  We were offered a choice of bread from a lovely selection - but the slices were wafer thin (not being greedy but .........) It was lovely though and we were offered more later on so - all ok in the end. Our starters were good and my hubby's main was good too, my main was nice (but nothing to write home about). Despite there being so many staff available, we weren't asked if our food was ok until we'd just about finished. Not a biggie as there weren't really any issues, but I really expected the service to be a bit slicker. Our bill was reasonable £44 for two courses with one soft drink each, but would have been pricey if we'd had any wine. The food was good, not exceptional, the service could be improved, but I'm afraid we think that the venue needs a lot of attention in order to improve the overall experience. As it stands, we won't be rushing back anytime soon, nor will be feel able to recommend this place to anyone. 
-2	I was on my own in Exmouth and fancied a pizza for my supper. Prezzo was the first place I found & didn't want to spend a long time looking - mistake! The staff didn't seem interested in me o my order, the starter (cheese & tomatoes - hardly difficult) took 1/2 hour to arrive, the spaghetti bolognaise arrived on a cold plate and was lukewarm to start with, the sauce tasted as though it came from a tin. Despite the 'trendy' menu this is a very disappointing place to eat.
-2	 Wagamamas is usually a safe choice for dinner. I just came back from a meal there with a friend. I ordered the new seafood ramen as I love seafood and have enjoyed waga ramens in the past but this one was not at all nice! It was just warmish when it arrived and the broth didn't have a very nice taste. Weak and fishy. I was surprised that the tiger prawns are not peeled and have the shell on - I have eaten many seafood ramens and they are always peeled. You don't really want to have to put your fingers in your ramen ideally do you??  The breaded tilapia was soggy/spongey but I admit that maybe that's just my taste. It was almost £14 just for that dish. So I would recommend choosing something else, I usually go for the itame which is much better. 
-2	 I tried to go to the Beach Hut and failed! I used to love going to the Beach Hut as it was a welcoming unpretentious place to go and get a cocktail or a hot chocolate after a day on the beach. Now it is bookings only and that has taken away from the chilled out experience of a beach bar, that used to cater for everyone. I think the bar itself is in such a great location and the food used to be really good, the staff were welcoming and you didn't need to wait to be seated just to have a drink, you could share tables with strangers if there was a space and make new friends, it's all gone a bit wrong which is really sad. 
-2	 Recently had afternoon tea at the Radisson Blu. The afternoon tea itself was ok though the bread on the sandwiches was definitely stale like it had been sat out for a while (we were there at 2pm so I think we would have been one of the first for afternoon tea). We didn't really get the option of any tea either - we were just asked 'tea, coffee or hot chocolate?'. However the cakes were really nice and the scones were ok. The staff were pretty rude as soon as we walked in and were not very helpful in any way. I asked one waitress where the toilet was and she just kept walking straight past me and shouted 'down the stairs' over her shoulder.  All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place for anything other than the cakes and the location is good for people watching 
-2	 What a disappointment on visiting this Wetherspoons today. After visiting this location on several other occcasions it has always lived up to the standard expected, but not today. The service at the bar was extremely slow and then on receiving the coffee there were no saucers or spoons offered. I checked at the end of the bar and they were available on request - but are normally provided with the cups. The meal was a true disappointment, It was quite a simple meal to prepare, eggs ham and chips, but the eggs were brown and shrivelled at edges and the yolks hard and overcooked. The table was stained from previous guests and did not get wiped. There was no check back on the meal so never had the opportunity to complain about the meal. The visit to the toilets was also not as expected with paper over most of the cubicle floors. As I visit other Wetherspoon pubs quite often I know this is not the overall standard but I will certainly not be visiting this location again unless there are all round improvements. 
-2	 Having been here for breakfast, I was keen to return for lunch. I was so disappointed. Service was polite, but the food wasn't great for the following reasons. According to the menu, my tuna nicoise should have been served with a seared tuna steak - instead small carpaccio type slices of tuna cooked through were presented (from the menu it's clear that tuna carpaccio is offered as a starter) and the tomatoes and olives were missing, (they came later when requested). The kid's fish fingers were served as piece of fish (nice fish but given how fussy kids can be they should have checked this was ok rather than placing the plate down saying it was still fish fingers), a pasta dish was presented with parmesan on it having been requested to be left off, and the kids popcorn chicken was very peppery. At no point were we asked if everything was ok and no thanks were given even when we paid the bill. Poor. 
-2	 We live locally and have eaten here before. Table booked for 12.30, and as I was meeting a friend who works in Sandwich, we arrived promptly and our order was taken shortly afterwards, one sausage sandwich, and a bacon huffkin. At 1 o'clock we chased the order up and was told it would be out shortly. It wasn't particularly busy, perhaps 3 tables before us and that food came out fairly quickly. At 1.15, the order was chased again, and we explained that my friend had to return to work at 1.30! The waitress was very apologetic and said there was a trainee chef in the kitchen, and that he was waiting for the sausages!!! And still we waited ....... At 1.30 we took the food away in a take away bag, not ideal. The waitress again apologised and did waive the charge, but we were very disappointed with the level of service we received. I apologise for giving her a hard time, but feel we were given a very poor excuse. She was very badly let down by the kitchen staff and should never have been put in that position. 
-2	 Myself and my partner hold a special place in our hearts for Kamillos, we went on some of our very first dates there, and have been there quite a few times to celebrate many milestones in our life together. So it only seemed right we go for a romantic meal to discuss our future wedding plans at Kamillos.   It was a Thursday evening we arrived at 8pm the restaurant was 3/4 full so not in my eyes busy by any stretch. Once seated we waited for 15 mins for our drinks/starter/mains orders to be taken. Time ticked by and we waited for 40mins for our starters to arrive!!! And only then was mine brought out my partner was not given his. We waited for 10 mins and still no starter for my partner, we spoke to one of the waiters who didn't have a clue what was going on, he went to the kitchen and after some Italian words had been exchanged we then noticed one of the older waiters running out of the restaurant and up the road only to return a moment later with some bacon that was quickly ushered into the kitchen!! Soon after that my partners starter arrived! No sorry or anything!   By this time it was 9pm and we had been there for an hour and only had our starters no mains, we waited a further 30 mins for our mains and when they had still not arrived I finally snapped and asked for the bill! I explained we could not possibly wait any longer as we had a baby sitter at home who we didn't want to keep all night. Nobody said sorry except once the waiter came over with the bill he simply said &quot;just pay for drinks we take starters off&quot; we left the money and went. Utterly heart broken that our favourite restaurant seems to have lost all the things we loved about it so much. We. Will defiantly not be returning again, as I simply would have the patience to go through that shocking service again. 
-2	 Went before the rugby, young waiter didnt really know what he was doing - not his fault they shouldnt have new staff on the floor on a busy friday evening!! Waited about 45 mins for food, one meal had to be sent back as it was cold by the time it came back out I had finished so we ate seperatly. Had to go to the bar to pay as no one came to clear our plates, we weren't asked how it was which was probally for the best as we would of complained!! Dont waste your time or money theres plenty of other lovely places in warrington!! 
-2	 My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times before and as you can see by my previous reviews we have always totally enjoyed it but tonight was a total disappointment.  We arrived without a prior reservation and where seated straight away which was great, ordered our starter although on the whole I was happy with my husband was very disappointed with his, main course mine tasted very much like it had had Oxo added to it. As for desert, well, it tasted of nothing!  We noticed that the couple next to us did'nt seem to impressed with their food either and subsequently sent one of their courses back.  Really don't think we will be in a rush to go back here after tonight which is a shame as the staff are, as always exceptionally friendly but when your paying £20 for a main course which is not up to scratch you can understand why we wont be rushing back. 
-2	As we arrived for lunch on the 8/3/16 we we're first greeted by a waitress who was kind and showed us to a table, the gave us menus and said to let her know when we wanted to order. We decided on the Buffett and went to go and get our food. Once we had sat back down a waiter came over and asked if we wanted any drinks or any sides we asked for water and where told to get it ourselves from the machine when other tables around us had gotten waitress service for their drinks. He then came back with the bill even though we had only been there for ten minutes! We felt that we where being pushed out of the restaurant! As a waitress I can understand that if you have lots of bookings you want to keep the tables available and clean but for a Tuesday lunch it was less than busy and the way we were approached by the waiter was not the way that I would have expected as a fellow waitress and it defiantly will not earn him any tips!
-2	 This is a run of the mill sort of place. Not a lot of character just somewhere to eat. Staff are polite but that is as far as it goes. Food is often left too long to keep warm as it is sometimes rubbery. 
-2	 We decided to go Aqua shard afternoon tea for our 1st anniversary to celebrate, the service was good at the beginning, and food were good too. as anniversary I had asked a special plate on the phone when i make a reservation for surprising my fiance. at the end, we finished the food but still not see our special plate coming. and i had to go to toilet as an excuse to away my fiance, and check with reception with the plate, when I asked them, they look like not received any message about it, but the manager(I think) he just asked me was a birthday or anniversary...then he just arranged for us. when i back to table my fiance already paid the bill. and I had to keep him at the talbe for waiting the plate, then we finally got the surprise to my fiance, but I was upset that restaurant departments communitcation is really poor. 
-2	Well this is tough, the staff were helpful early on, we had one of our party who wanted to watch the England game in the room. Fine, they said just order before 9:45 and it would be fine. well we did, the starters were grim, potato skins cold and uncooked, the prawns, horrible to look at and thankfully I didn't have to eat them, soggy and pale. The mains, fish & chips, my meal - burnt not well cooked but completely burnt, the ribs were shocking again hard and well overcooked, when the waiting staff asked the 'how is your meal' the person with the ribs didn't answer so she asked again, so the answer was 'sorry, but this is awful' she just said, oh. and walked away!!! the other meal the mixed grill was a mixed burnt, Harvester really you take the money you need to improve, personally I'm avoiding them from now on.
-2	 We visited this pub last Monday evening around 7pm with friends. We were one of two tables eating with two others stood at the bar. The menu is a pretty limited pub menu with heavy pies and meat, pretty much everything is served with chips on what I think is an expensive menu at around £12 for a main in a JW Lees pub. I scoped out the menu online and thought I would go for a salad but when I arrived, there were no salads on the menu and I was told it was because they were serving a limited menu due to there only being one chef working. My thought would be that the salad would be the easiest thing to make and the fact that by this point, we were the only table in there, it shouldn't have been too challenging for him. When I peered my head around the door to the kitchen in the other room, the chef was talking to a colleague who had finished his shift and was now stood having a beer. Once we had eaten our food, our plates were not cleared away until they brought us the bill probably 40 minutes later. I would have easily had another drink and even a dessert but this wasn't even offered to me. The decor is lovely but the room is cold. I think it could be made more warming and inviting by putting the beautiful woodburner on but instead I was sat with my shrug on on. It's such a shame as the location of this pub is quite decent and there are other pubs nearby that offer a better quality 3 course meal for not much more than the price for a main in here. I feel that it is trying to be a gastropub when it's nothing more than a pub selling pub food with a price that doesn't match the quality of the food and because of these things, it's not as good as it could be. 
-2	 Purchased a groupon deal after checking menu online and saw ample of options. However once in restaurant very disappointed that their webpage menu prices are cheaper than the restuarant menu prices so limited on starter £4.95 and main courses £8.95. Also very slow service - booked table for 6pm on a saturday night and it took 30 mins for the food order to be taken. Food wasn't up to much and my chilli chicken curry and 6 very small pieces of chicken and the rest was sauce.  I did also purchase a living social deal for main course and a glass of wine but have now cancelled it as was very diappointed with the service and food. 
-2	 I like to think I'm a wised up traveller and booked a table for 3 on the basis of reviews. I new it would be pricey but with a gourmet card their advertised discount is 2 for one on starter, main and dessert. We never normally go for dessert when we go out for a curry but my husband and son forced themselves! The food was good, the ambience ok, and the service fine. The bill presented was for £89 for the 3 of us and I was told that the gourmet discount had been applied. Stunned, I paid up. In the car I checked the bill and they had given just one main dish discount. I returned to the restaurant immediately to query it.   I had told them that we would be a party of 3, and asked to use the gourmet card discount when I booked....they refused point blank to honour the offer. Now in my book, 2 people ordered 3 courses, I had main course, rice, and a side dish. We ordered beers, naan, popadum etc - I fully expected the 2 for one discount to be applied and to pay in full for the remainder.   Buyer beware - London prices expensive and not even an apology for the 'confusion'. I showed them their entry on the Gourmet Society website and they merely shrugged.   Eat here if you fancy being mugged by a neighbourhood curry house. 
-2	 The service was poor. Boy at bar disinterested in serving us we had to go and order our food at the bar eventually likewise when paying. Food very average, duck very overcooked. Won't be going back. 
-2	 We booked a table for 9 of us on Friday evening. It took over half an hour to get our drinks order, some of which was wrong. When we pointed this out the waitress had a complete strop and virtually threw my daughters drink at her! We then asked to order food which she also had a complete strop about! The food order eventually arrived but also eas wrong. By this time we didn't want to complain...... woefully understaffed, and the staff that were there were too stressed! 
-2	 I don't often leave poor reviews, but after my experience here today I have to say I am bitterly disappointed.  Tried this place a couple of weeks ago, we sat down to be told they had stopped serving food, an hour before closing. Fair enough, but perhaps it would be better to make this clear on the phone when somebody is ringing up to find out?! Ended up going to The Filling Station instead (lovely!).  Went at lunchtime. It was very busy, we managed to find a couple of people we knew so went to sit with them as nobody bothered to even acknowledge us at first. Then we were told the table was booked out so we were moved.  Bit inconvenient but couldn't really complain.  However, I did not like our waitress who gave us the funniest looks and I just didn't feel welcome there at all. There was no real warmth, and the icing on the cake for me was when I asked if my daughter could have a cheese & ham sandwich (as they were both listed on the menu) and I was firmly told NO, either you can have cheese or ham. Felt like I was at school despite being a grown woman. That really got my back up.  At this point I was not looking forward to the food. I was right not to, it was bland, boring and I was really annoyed that I had chosen to come here instead of another place.  My daughter's food was literally a quartered sandwich, like I would throw together for a quick lunch at home. No sides, poor presentation, it just looked awful and really poor for a place with such a high profile in Retford. Our food generously came with a handful of limp, undressed salad. There was never a mention of sides when we were ordering to whet our appetite.  In fairness, my Mum did say her panini was tasty, but my Son did not like the cream on his scone and upon tasting it myself, it resembled cream from a can.  I was rooting for this place as I want it to be that special something that we don't have in Retford. Whilst the deli side is fantastic, the customer service and dining element needs a serious overhaul. We will never eat here again. 
-2	 I had read reviews of The Old Stables before we went there and was prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt as any place next to a racecourse on raceday is going to be busy. This said, as there is no other establishment of this type anywhere near they have no competition and clearly don't feel they have to try too hard. We arrived around 730pm (racing finished at 5pm) to find they were still busy. There were glasses on a lot of tables and the staff were working on clearing them. We waited approx 5 mins to be served a drink and seated, where the waitress abruptly told us 'no roast chicken, no cod, no steak'. When we ordered, we made a point of stating no tomato on the burger because of allergies, to then be served a burger with tomato! We were then told that there were no more burger buns! Seems our order had been delivered to another table in error, so I asked if we could just have the burger without a bun which they did. Give the waitress her due, after the initial bad impression we had of her, she did handle this situation well and they even went so far as to not charge for the meal. The other meal was ok, steak and mushroom pie - lot of hot air under the pastry crust & literally one piece of mushroom - the vegetables were overcooked and the presentation poor (don't think they had peeled the carrots!!) 
-2	 We were delighted that the Roebuck, closed for some years, had again reopened. We visited on a Friday evening. We were shown to a small table wedged in along the far side of the restaurant alongside 4 other tables. We had to squeeze past, trying not to disturb other diners, to get into our seats. We might as well have been all sat together. I felt we were intruding in others conversations and they on ours. Not the cosy evening we had planned. The food was beautiful and the service fresh and helpful. However too many tables were packed into too small a space. In addition, the lack of any soft furnishings in the room meant that the acoustics were awful. You had to shout across the table for your other half to hear you, yet the sound from other tables was deafening. It's a shame. The food is gorgeous. But the experience is very lacking. Needs fewer tables and a more cosy ambience. Won't go back sorry. 
-2	 If you are vegetarian avoid. The best I was offered after asking the waitress 3 times what the veggie options were was an omelette or a stir fry! I eat these every day at home. If I’m out for a treat I want a treat and especially at these prices.  Service from one waitress was superb but the other one was clearly having an off day, not what you would expect from this kind of establishment. 
-2	 The title says it all. I did not find this to be authentic Indian food. The waiters are a tad creepy and often standing around. I have had experiences like this in the past there but a friend talked me into going back, that's the last time 
-2	 We attended a wedding here and was very disappointed. It was small with very average food. The dance floor was minuscule and I could not dance. According to the brides mother it was very over priced and both the bride and groom wished they had chosen another venue. The pricing was misleading from the start, but they could not pull out as they had paid a £700 deposit which was not refundable, so they felt they had no alternative that to go ahead. 
-2	We tried out the Pommel Horse soon after it first opened for a late lunch one Saturday and were sadly disappointed.   We were shown to our table and asked to order our food at the bar which would have been perfectly fine except that the bar was incredibly busy with only two staff to take all food and drink orders.   It took a good 10 minutes standing at the bar to actually give our order and then had to wait another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. When it did arrive our food was only average - very basic burgers (meat, bun and a lettuce leaf).   It has put us off returning for fear of having to wait again so long for not so good food. They definitely need to sort out the short staffing issue to reduce the crazy wait times!
-2	 First visit since this replaced La Tasca, wont be back. Waitress tried to memorise 6 meals, came back to check and had 4 of them wrong. Corrected her and still they managed to get 1 meal wrong. Cocktail jugs may appear cheap but judging by the taste its mainly mixer. Waitress also got drinks order wrong, twice! Noisy, no atmosphere and feels a bit 'cold'. All I can say is bring back La Tasca which had good food, good staff and felt welcoming, las Iguanas is none of these things and was a big disappointment. 
-2	Went here last Sunday for desserts after dining elsewhere. My daughter in-law suggested this place as she'd been before. I was not impressed with the building. All we could smell upon entering was a nasty cleaning fluid. It did not smell fresh either, it was a mixture of dirty cloths and a high scent of stale perfume. I don't think it helps that the cafe itself is in a downstairs basement set up and so suffers from any natural ventilation.When I walk in to an eatery I expect to smell food and this was most unpleasant. It was only because of my daughter in-law that we stayed. I didn't want to hurt her feelings after she'd bigged the place up. I think she saw it in a new light too though.  Having said that the desserts weren't too bad, although on nicking a bit of my son's waffle, it did taste a little like it had been contaminated with the sickly cleaning fluid. My chocolate pudding was fine but served with cheap squirty cream which lacked substance and turned to a watery puddle within seconds of being served. Would have been much nicer had it been served with proper cream and for the price paid I expected it would have been. I think Tinseltown's forte is in its shakes and smoothies. My husband had one and it was excellent. The whole place is tired with cheap and knackered fixtures and fittings. It could be lovely and it's a real shame because it's a great concept to have an American diner - it just didn't live up to my expectation.Think I will stick to Frankie and Benny's or Gelato for desserts next time.  Staff pleasant enough and hard working. It seemed to be non-stop whizzing and frothing behind the counter and it wasn't even busy with only a handful of other diners.
-2	 Combibos was my go-to coffee shop, but I've had too many bad experiences with the cold air there! The staff are moving around a lot, so they want the doors open. But for the customers who are sitting, reading, and enjoying their coffee, the cafe can get extremely cold & uncomfortable with the doors.   Staff seem to care more about their own comfort than that of their customers. On over five separate occasions, I politely asked staff to shut the door, telling them that I (and often the customers sitting around me, judging from the shivers and complaints!) was very cold. They never accommodated me-- not even once. Other friends of mine who are students here at Oxford stopped going for the same reason-- they go to Nero at Blackwells, which is always a cosy temperature.   Other coffee shops in town prioritize customer comfort. Rick's on Cowley Road, for instance, is very accommodating.   If they could work out the temperature situation, or learn how to accommodate customers a little bit more (especially when those customers come nearly every single day!!) I'd go back. It's a cute coffee shop in a great location. It's just often too cold to get anything done! 
-2	Hadn't been here for ages, three friends for lunch.. Firstly, on the plus side, the pudding, a 'sharing' plate was excellent. The main courses were ok. However, the service was appalling;the staff (apart from one very smiley jolly waitress) were surly to the point of rudeness, eclipsed only by the manager who was positively hostile. It is a very long time since we've experienced anything quite as astonishingly poor.
-2	 The food here is pretty much the same as the sister restaurant by same chef in Covent Garden, fried oysters £8, salmon roulade with sweet potato £8, rosemary lamb chops at £9. I found the menu pretentious - what in the world is an 'artisanal snack?' A zero rating for food hygiene is a complete turnoff. How on earth can places run with a zero rating - that the worst possible. Great setting - shame about the hygiene. 
-2	 I visited here with a group of friends on a hen party. We were not overly impressed by the friendliness or service, in particular that this cafe has a policy of not providing tap water for paying customers. There didn't seem to be any reason for this other than them wanting to charge for water from the fridge. When I asked why I got some vague reason about 'when it's busy blah blah'- it wasn't even remotely busy when we were there!   Food wasn't particularly imaginative and there wasn't much choice for the veggies among us other than cheddar. We also had salad on our plates for which no utensils were given to eat it other than a knife, and weren't sure if this meant it was there for decoration and not actually edible.  I have lived in Bath for several years and there are plenty of lovely cafes and tea rooms around the city, so in future I will not be bringing my friends to this one. 
-2	 Was a beautiful sunny day,so decided to try here for a family meal.Beautiful views from the garden, and that's about as good as it gets.Ordered starters and main meal at bar,decided to eat in garden.Starters came,which was nice, and then we waited and waited and waited! My husband informed the staff we were still awaiting our main meal, and eventually it arrived by which time it was quite dark outside,so struggled to see what we were eating.I had also ordered a side extra of mushrooms,which turned up(after being reminded) just as I was finishing my meal.Food ok but not the best I've had,service from Kitchen,absolutely dire! Needless to say won't be returning,which is a shame as the location is stunning.Oh and only one person serving behind the bar! 
-2	 Stayed for 1 night recently - really wished I hadn't. Landlady's attitude aggressive and confrontational to mildest question. Not the slightest hint of a welcome. Couldn't wait to get out and have a meal in a normal atmosphere. Room OK. 
-2	 We went here for afternoon tea last Friday. It’s not the best I've ever had, but wasn't terrible. I was expecting a lot better, since it's a bakery and their cakes generally are delicious. When we arrived we were shown to our table. The venue its self is a lovely little place. We were pretty disappointed when the waiter bought over out cake stand. The selection was bad. A couple of sandwiches, which were tasty, but not enough. some tine tiny brownies. Which weren't very nice at all, tasted stale. We each got one scone which was very nice, by far the best of the selection. We also got a cupcake each which wasn't very nice either. One was chocolate with a rasberry buttercream the other coffee, which tasted even worse.   All in all we had a nice time because of the company and venue. We were not impressed by the selection at all. I know it's not an expensive afternoon tea, but it still wasn't worth £19 in my opinion. 
-2	 Use to always go here for decent food and excellent service. Can be pricey unless you go for special deals. Did have one major issue the house wine was advertised as a certain brand and when it came it was much cheaper wine than advertised on menu and it was disgusting! When I complained the only option was to pay more for a better bottle. No apologies and used excuse menus had not been updated. There was a wedding going on and they were ordering copious amounts of house wine but not being told it wasn't the decent brand on the menu. So very disappointed now & reluctant to go back. CHECK WHAT YOU ARE GETTING! 
-2	It's never bloody open on time it always opens 30 minutes after it should and the chicken isn't cooked 100%!! I really recommend the kfc at parkgate which is high on good service.
-2	Unsure what has happened here - one of our regular spots for a weekend drink and on arriving at the bar we were asked to move further down the bar to be served - very odd behaviour as we were previously ignored, couldn't the bar man move over to us further down the bar? Very strange but perhaps new bar staff, also used to recieve water to the table when drinking either wine or champagne and that didn't arrive either. Wasn't even busy. Sorry Epernay, there are so many nice places to drink in Manchester where you are treated well and you certainly put our small party of 4 off returning - such a shame!!!!
-2	 In desperation as we had been stuck in lots of Good Friday jams needed W.C, drink and food we ate here. Pint of cider & 1/2 lager quite expensive, we both ordered fish & chips, service good, fish ok, chunky chips not that nice nothing like chips at all really, mushy peas had mint added made them odd tasting, @ £16 pp !! Oh & 2 slices of bread & butter £2.10 ! Hubby then decided to try cheeseboard thinking that as it was £9.95 Its gotta be good how wrong he was, 3 small pieces of cheese couple of strands of celery,& a tiny bit if grape jelly! no apple no grapes no tomato, crackers were like little square doritos & couple of nasty sweet oaty squares, hubby had to ask for butter too ! My dessert was totally horrible it was rum sponge with pineapple & coconut ice cream @ £7.95 - it was a sickly sweet very cold soaked donut in rum, tinny squares of pineapple&some nasty bits of rum soaked pineapple coconut ice cream 1 tiny scoop of vanilla with a tiny bit of dessicated coconut on it. So with our drinks we spent nearly £70 on this fancy food where they think they can charge ridiculous prices. I wished myself and hubby had sent our dessert & cheeseboard back as they were both v poor value & generally awful ! You have been warned its pretentious & way too expensive. 
-2	I visited Bills in April 2015 to meet some friends for lunch. The food was lovely and the restaurant is well positioned and rustic in decor. However when the bill was presented it had a 10% gratuity which said was 'an optional discretionary gratuity'. We decided to pay for the food and drink and left our own tip, not quite the 10% they automatically added. On leaving the restaurant we were approached by the waiter who demanded we pay the rest of the tip. We questioned him and said that it stated optional and discretionary. He argued and wouldn't let us leave unless it was paid. In my opinion it should be down to the consumer to decide if a tip should be given for any service (except if it is a large party) but to be ordered by a member of staff to pay the 'optional' tip was outrageous. What was supposed to be a lovely lunch was tarnished by this waiters behaviour. Hence the 2 star. I would like to know what Bills management think of this. We will definitely think twice about coming back to this chain.
-2	 After trying both restaurants we were very disappointed with Plymouth. Rather than having that 'special' feel that Axminster and its food generate, Plymouth felt like just another town / city centre chain gastro bar / restaurant, with food to match. Service was fine, and the atmosphere was quite buzzy, but we shall not be going back, nor recommending it to our friends. 
-2	 Please let me start by explaining that this is not about rating the food as my party did not dine given the mix up with the menu availability due to my mistake. The complaint and the rating of two was given in regards to the very rude attitude of the person who spoke to me regarding my mix up. The lady explained that the phone call regarding the availability of the Christmas menu for eight and not four persons was taken by her only &quot; the only one who took bookings&quot;. Two phone calls to enquire about this availability for four with assurances was given by a male and not a female. Please note that if this abrupt tone of voice and attitude that we were both (husband and I) were mistaken had been more positive the booking would still have been honored. Looking at other reviews other people must had a similar experience of this restaurant with regards to queries. This was my fiftieth birthday it could have been a disaster but fate took over for the day and I dined with my family at a fantastic restaurant in Caistor. 
-2	Had looked forward to a first visit to local TGI's but was rather disappointed by the whole experience. Really slow service in all respects, being seated at pre- booked table despite several empty tables, then the appearance of a waiter, then drinks, then food.... Waiter very pleasant but obviously didn't know what he was doing. Food nice enough but not very hot! There is lots of competition locally now so they need to up their game if they want to stay.  Will give it one more try.
-2	 We came here long time ago when I was younger and my grandparents were alive The food and service was good. but came here last fri went to the bar for a cappuccino it lookes like a latte with a lot of coffee that was strong and as I worked in the catering buissness It was not nice and not the way u do a cappuccino .then wanted a meal here took awhile for the waitress to notice us then was seated and then the food took half a hour and mine and my husband Order came out wrong so she said sorry I go and tell the kitchen so we eat it anyway burn burger buns very little saled not what I would call a saled with peppers in it ... It wasn't worth £32 pounds it came to won't be return here is a shame because we used to love it here !! 
-2	 We had to wait 30mins even when the seats were available because the staff did not have time to clean and set up. Over priced for the portions and quality. We will not be visiting again. 
-2	 Below average pub grub. Food & service was poor - very disappointing. Visiting IOW for weekend & gave this a try as good reviews but burger & scampi weren't good. Burger van style burger & expected more for scampi on IoW. 
-2	 We have been there in the past and had no problems, but this time I was appalled by the food, which was expensive and inedible! We left it. We sat in the garden and were besieged by flies, surely there must be a way for a pub serving food in the garden to counteract this? The lamb was under-cooked, and consisted mainly of fatty lumps. The sea bass was small, undercooked, under-seasoned and served on a huge bed of spaghetti which was not adequately described as such on the menu. The price for 2 drinks and 2 meals was extortionate even if the food had been edible.As the number of pubs in the area is diminishing the remainder really need to make a bit more effort to attract discerning customers 
-2	 We booked a table for 4 people 3 months ago for your Mad Hatters Tea party. We were due to sit down at 3.30pm. We had all arrived by 3.20pm and were told we should wait at the bar as our table wasn't yet ready.  We weren't seated until 5pm, and at no point in this 1 hour and 30 minute wait did anyone from the hotel come to apologise. It was only when I went up to the desk to ask how much longer we would have to wait were we seated.  Once seated we then had another 25 minutes wait for any of the savoury items of the afternoon tea to arrive, but again this was only after I asked one of the waiters again how much longer we would have to wait. Our waitress was pleasant but again we received no apology for the long wait. By the time our savoury items of the afternoon arrived we had waited 2 hours.  We were all extremely disappointed with the terrible customer service (or rather complete lack of it), the long wait, no apology and quite frankly very disappointing entire experience. At the end of the afternoon tea I asked the waitress who took my payment if I could speak to the manager, and she said would go and get him straight away for me. £56 each is a lot of money for a very poor afternoon tea, and I fee completely ripped off by the whole experience. I have been to several other places for afternoon tea who charge a lot less but do it a lot better (Bettys of Harrogate, Fortnum & Mason, The Spice pear in Yorkshire....).  We then waited a further 15-20 mins but no manager showed up so we left.   The actual afternoon was nice enough but not amazing, especially for the price. 
-2	 We were looking forward to our visit here, and were disappointed. We had to wait for a seat which we didn't mind at all- we weren't in a rush. At our table the first thing we were asked was if we'd be paying separately or together, which was odd! I guess that most customers are younger and want to split the bill? It was absolutely boiling in there- I'm pregnant and it made me feel really unwell. We ordered a milkshake, a crepe and a waffle, which came to nearly £15. The waiter disappeared off and then came back a few minutes later to demand payment- we hadn't had the food yet- which is really odd and made us feel uncomfortable! You expect this in places like McDonalds, but Kaspas has prices which set it apart form strictly 'fast food' eateries.  We then realised that the waiter hadn't asked us if we wanted cream or ice cream with our orders- the menu says that you can choose. We stopped him to query this and he said &quot;you ordered ice cream&quot;. Erm... No we didn't. You didn't ask us. Decided to let it go but then realised that the ice cream that was coming out with crepes was Mr Whippy (which you can't have in pregnancy), so my husband went up to the counter and asked them to give me some soft scoop ice cream instead. They did this with no problem, but if the waiter had actually asked us in the first place then we would've been saved doing this.  The food was... Ok. Waffle was really flavourless but toppings were nice. The crepe was really good but not really a crepe- too heavy and stodgy. The ice cream was half melted before we even got our food. Nobody came to ask if we were happy with our food, and when we left nobody said goodbye or thank you.  Final point: Portions are massive here but they don't seem to advise parents that children might want to share. There were 2 toddlers on the table next to us who had eaten about 1/5th of their desserts. What a waste.  All in all- no way would we come back. It's overpriced for the level of service you get. Such a shame as we were fully expecting to love it! 
-2	 We went as a family for my husbands 49th birthday. We ordered a selection of seafood and pizza. The pizza came not only late (15 minutes after the other food), but it was also lukewarm. Whilst the waiters were apologetic, some staff members appeared flippant and unsympathetic. The restaurant was very cramped and we couldn't enjoy our evening as we could hear the conversation of the table next to us and it was not family friendly. Whats more, due to the cramped conditions I had to move my chair every time a waiter wanted to pass, which didn't make for a relaxing evening. Overall we cannot see the appeal of this over-priced, glorified pub. 
-2	 Came on a Sunday afternoon. It was very busy and was told we would have to wait up to an hour so waited in the play area, the waitress then didn't come over to call our name and called it from the other end of the pub which we didn't hear. While waiting there was at least 8 empty tables which hadn't been cleared yet we were still waiting for a table. Staff were rude and not very helpful. Good was lovely though. 
-2	 We visited Epsom Thai last night - I'd booked a table and was meeting my boyfriend inside. I turned up at the restaurant, there were 4 waitresses standing at the back of the restaurant, none of them came up to me to say hello, one of them just pointed in the vague direction of where my boyfriend was sitting!! Not even a Hello, just a point - great start!  The food was sub-standard - a tiny plate of cheap, stale prawn crackers (I think there were literally 4!), rubbery prawn tempura, evidently deep-fried from frozen, not a good taste at all. The Massaman curry was like a thick gravy - I've been to Thailand and therefore have tasted authentic Thai food - and the Pad Thai was bland, probably the best dish of the lot, but it was just very standard - could have done with a wedge of lime to spruce it up! There was only 1 white wine offered by the glass - the house white, which wasn't very nice. Stick to the Chang beer!  The service was abrupt and rude. There was 1 nice waitress attempting to make up for the rest - I think she said sorry about 20 times. The others are just plain rude - no attempt to try and serve in a friendly way - do they want a tip?? As one waitress was serving our main course, she was shouting instructions in Thai to another waitress the other side of the restaurant! The same waitress I tried to ask for a glass of wine and she walked off half way through my question - just walked off! To conclude, the service is lazy, slow and rude!  I'm actually feeling quite rough this morning - was it the rubbery prawns, the gravy curry or the cheap wine - take your pick!  Of course I won't be coming here again and I'm losing the will to live with the amount of poor restaurants there are in Epsom! 
-2	 Seven adults and three children visited on Sunday 21 June for a Father's Day lunch. We had opted for an early booking at midday and, like Thehungryboy, were rather surprised to be told straightaway that none of the salmon dishes were available, nor was the mushroom starter, which immediately indicated that the restaurant was not well prepared for an obviously busy day like Father's Day. We also waited over an hour for our starters and had another long wait for our mains. The food was very average and there was nothing in these dishes that should have taken so long to prepare and present. The waitresses did their best but it was clear that the kitchen could not cope with a fully booked restaurant, made worse by the number of ad hoc diners in the garden. We did not finish our meal until around 4.00 pm. My daughter in law, who has been a restaurant manager herself, did manage to get a reduction in the bill, but it is a shame that a restaurant in such an attractive setting should be so let down by such poor service. 
-2	 We dined here as a family and were anticipating a lovely meal to match the delightful exterior and garden, which also had a good play area. Unfortunately, out of seven meals, only two were good, two satisfactory and three unacceptable. We did not complain as it was a family reunion and no-one wished to spoil the evening, so I accept the retaurant did not have chance to make reparation. However, at least two dishes should never have left the kitchen as they were inedible. Mine, jerk pork, was too hot to eat. I recognize that people have different tolerances and the dish was marked as hot and spicy but I lived in Jamaica for three years and never came across anything as hot as this. moreover, I am renowned in our family for my love of hot curries and chillis, which is why I ordered the dish in the first place. But after two mouthfuls (I'm a glutton for punishment) I had to concede defeat. My son tried and also gave up. It was literally inedible. The other inedible dish was my 6 year old grand-daughter's. It was sausage and mash, which she loves. The minor criticism was that the amount was huge for a child's portion, quite daunting, in fact. But the major criticism was that the mash was too salty. None of us could eat it. The menu offered two courses for £28. To me, this is steep for a pub meal. The only justification would be food to die for, and this was certainly not. 
-2	 Thought this was a bargain when I bought the voucher, £16.99 for three course lunch for two. I went with my daughter and my 11 yr old grandson joined us at the last minute as school finished early that day so I increased the booking to three and said I would pay the extra. My daughter was really looking forward to going as she had heard great things about the carvery from friends that go at the weekend. It was sadly disappointing. no one to seat us when we arrived to an almost deserted restaurant so we seated ourselves. No sign of a waiter after some time so went to the bar to check on format in case we were supposed to order at the bar. Was told a waiter would be over shortly. We eventually placed our order for starters which took quite some time to arrive but were nice when they did arrive, there was a choice of 2 on the offer. we then went up to the unattended carvery and waited a while. We were told they would fetch the chef to carve and he was very pleasant once he showed up. (We did spot other customers later attempting to carve their own as they waited so long there without any kind of acknowledgement). There was a choice of 2 meats, turkey or beef, both covered with tin foil and very dry. Small choice of veg was over cooked and soggy. My grandson said his roast potatoes tasted funny and didnt eat them, I have my suspicions some or all of it may have been reheated. Deserts were nice, ice cream or chocolate brownie. Staff were noticable by their absence and I went to the bar again to ask if we could order dessert. All in all very disappointing. Granted we didnt pay much but could have got same price at far better quality at a Toby. All agreed we wont bother again. If this offer was intended to encourage mid week lunch time custom they failed badly. 
-2	 I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant and wasn't disappointed with our duck pancakes to start. However our main courses arrived and they looked to have been made with MSG (thick gravy sauce for a supposed fresh beef stir fry!). It was not stated on the menu that any items contained MSG. Being allergic to MSG (it makes the heart beat faster than normal) I asked the question whether the main courses contained MSG but the waiting staff didn't know what it was. After a few minutes they returned after speaking with the chef I presume and I was told it did have MSG in it and they asked if I was allergic. I said I was to which point the waitress was very rude and stated I should have told them when I placed the order.  I was a little annoyed at the response from the staff. If the food was prepared fresh there would be to need to add MSG. When the staff then queried why we wasn't going to pay the optional 12.5% service charge, I was made to write an explanation on the back of the bill for the manager!  No apologies given at any point. Very disappointing! 
-2	I've been coming here for a while now and it seems to be getting worse. Firstly the bar staff aren't very forthcoming, in fact I would go as far to say that they are quite standoffish and just generally rude. They are slow and stand there chatting while you're left waiting to be served. Secondly, there is only one female toilet and it is absolutely disgusting. There's no lock and the toilet itself is seems to constantly leak covering the floor of the tiny cubicle in a puddle of water. This means that going to the toilet if you’re woman is some kind of manoeuvrability exercise where the first challenge is to keep your feet from getting soaked while also making sure you keep the door pushed closed. Lastly, they call time with no advance warning so you can find yourself being told to leave while having bought a pint less than 10 minutes before. The management aren't very polite, bordering on pushy when asking you to leave and tell you to put your nearly full pint in a plastic cup and take it with you. Definitely won’t bother with this place again. I've heard this place does good food but never had it so can't comment.
-2	 Arrived on time to be told table will be ready in a few minutes we were then escorted to the bar area and were still sitting there 40mins later we then called a member of staff over and asked how much longer we would have to wait for our table we were told only a few more minutes another 10 minutes went by and we were finally sat down at the table! We all ordered steaks when these arrived we were so disappointed full of gristle and just looked and tasted very average we ended up sending one back and half eating another! Beware over priced food poor service dirty tables unclean glasses and very very overpriced wine list! Absolute rubbish!!! Avoid 
-2	 This was the second time I had visited this pub. On both occasions the staff were off-hand and unhelpful and on my recent trip only grudgingly topped up my pint to the full level. Although we arrived at 2.30 pm and they advertise that meals are served until 3.00pm, we were told that we could only order sandwiches or puddings, and unfortunatley, neithr of these caters for customers who request gluten-free. Overall this was a very disappointing expereience and not one that I will repeat. 
-2	We booked a table for 10 people on line for a lunch at 12.00. We arrived promptly and got the feeling they were not expecting us. The two course lunch @ £12.00 pp was a bit pricey. They took our drinks orders quickly and it was ten minutes os so before the drinks arrived at the table.  We ordered from the menu, whilst waiting for the drinks to be servied and it was 45 minutes before any food arrived by which time we were needing to leave as our lunch hour was finishing. One person ordered chicken kebabs and they were still raw in the middle. The restaurant wasn't busy.
-2	 Lovely old pub with really great, modern and airy restaurant that is family friendly; very friendly and pleasant staff, super atmosphere. I had Sunday dinner there and the vegetarian option, Med Veg Wellington was a bit of a disaster as the pastry was flat and only luke warm with barely any vegetables. The broccali with cheddar cheese and roast potatoes were barely warm as well and I was so disappointed. The raspberry roulade was gorgeous though. My dinner date had ice cream which came in a very generous helping of local Styles ice cream but his roast dinner looked rather sparse. At about £16.80 each this was not very good. Perhaps they were having an off day but I would have thought being able to serve the food hot would not have been too difficult. 
-2	 We booked a table on Sunday as we had a great lunch here in the past. This time the menu was limited and if you didn't fancy a roast, there wasn't a lot to choose from. Our starters took about half hour to arrive (which the staff didn't acknowledge until they came to the table with our food)-whitebait was nice and sausage roll delicious, but tiny. After another twenty-thirty minutes wait for the main course, our starter plates still on the table, the main course arrived- my son was desperate for food by that time. And he got two (!) bits of battered cod, peas and a large pile of worst chips ever- they were hard and almost inedible. My husband had the misfortune of having ordered chips as well, alongside the burger. The burger came in a brioche bun, looked lovely, but didn't taste of much. Roast beef was adequate, nothing to rave about though. All in all, we were fed, we enjoyed the view, we felt like we could have had done much, much better elsewhere. 
-2	 I've been a fan of the beautiful Manor House and surrounding grounds since I was a child growing up in the area, I even harbored a secret desire to get married here! I took my Mum here for her birthday for afternoon tea. On arrival the reception staff waved us vaguely inside where we wondered around between the two rooms trying to find our table. When we found it, it was a table for 2 with a 3rd setting but only 2 chairs, we had to ask for a 3rd. As anticipated the table was too small for 3 people. When the afternoon tea arrived the sandwiches were bland and the bread wasn't fresh, we also had to remind the waiter for one of our drinks and ask them for a tea strainer for the loose leaf tea. I believe it is under new management judging by the redecoration, unfortunately the mix of the original elegant features with the overly modern almost garish renovation is unsympathetic and tasteless. It's incredibly unfortunate and for me personally actually very sad that this wasn't a lovely experience, we all left disappointed and won't be returning. I certainly wouldn't recommend going for afternoon tea. 
-2	 We ordered takeaway from here, not only did the food turn up in less than 30 minutes, it seemed like they had cooked the chicken then added the sauce to it. Unlikely to be ordering from them again. 
-2	 Sorry didn't enjoy our visit here we were a family of 5 adults and 1 child and we were placed in a booth and was squashed and uncomfortable, also to only allow a child 1 type of meat I myself am a carvery and we allow children to have a selection of meats so I think it's unfair to only let children only have one choice we will not be coming back for a meal again 
-2	The food wasn't terrible but was unexciting, service was average, won't be in a hurry to return, there's much nicer places to eat in the Old Market.
-2	 We had not been here since it was Edwinns and fancied going somewhere where we could go for a walk after lunch. We sat outside on the terrace and the views were absolutely stunning. We were quite late and did not have to wait long for our food, even though the pub was very full. The food was ok. I had the Cajun Chicken which could have done with more spice but was otherwise fine. My wife had the ploughman's but asked for a vegetarian version with no ham. This initially arrived with the ham and after it was sent back the exact quantity of cheese was returned which, in the event, was insufficient for the bread provided. It was only after we had finished that anyone asked if everything was alright and we pointed out the issue. The response received was that they should have put more cheese on. When paying the bill, this was charged as if it was the standard ploughman's. I once again pointed out that we did not have any ham and that no additional cheese had been provided and again the server said that they should have put more cheese on. The consequence is a feeling of being ripped off. What is worse is that the cheese plate for dessert offers more cheeses and is cheaper.  The food was very expensive for what we had. The crumble for dessert had been pre-prepared and then microwaved and really wasn't great. It's a shame as the location is lovely but with such poor value for the food, we will only be tempted back for a drink. 
-2	We visited for a birthday. Slow service and when we asked for a childs orange juice to be changed because it tasted awful the waitress said that it was a fresh carton just opened so there couldn't be anything wrong with it! Everything took a very long time to be served and was ridiculously hot. Most of the food was tasteless and far too over cooked. I had spaghetti bolagnese - the pasta was so over cooked I couldn't eat it and the mince smushy just like it was from a tin! The waitress never asked if everything was ok with our food.  The bill came with an automatic service charge of 10% on it which we refused to pay.
-2	 The Lighthouse is a three storey restaurant with cocktail bar downstairs. We went in for a drink and possibly food. We should have stuck with just a drink. We were offered any table downstairs and ordered a beer and a mulled wine. Mulled wine was good. After finishing our drinks, we tried to get the attention of the waitress to ask for a menu. All the staff were behind the bar laughing and joking with each other. I eventually got up and ask for menus. I order a chicken Caesar salad with garlic bread and my other half ordered a medium fillet steak. The chicken in the salad was so over cooked I needed the steak knife to cut it and there was so much lettuce that I left over half. The steak, which was meant to be medium, was very well done. It was just after 6pm on a Friday night and the place was not that busy but service and food were poor. I would not be returning here. 
-2	 young unattentive staff with very little customer focus. took money fast, then vanished every time we neede them toilets obviously were not checked regularly! 
-2	 We had to wait to be seated and found that the £4.99 full English breakfast advertised did not include a drink this was an extra £2.25ea, then to add insult to injury although this was supposed to be free refills there were no glasses or mugs to get a drink at all. The was no decaff coffee available so I was charged for a cup of hot water out of a wet cup as the staff brought 3 cups out before they had been dried. The butter and various sauce pots were empty and we had to ask 3 times for more stock, it was a fight to get cutlery, and a queue for the toaster (underdone or burnt if put through again) was making customers irritated. When the food eventually arrived some 30-40 minutes after we arrived it was hot but the scrambled egg was rubbery, the bacon salty and sausages bland. The staff was making an effort to restock all items but not fast enough, it was although they were surprised that people wanted breakfast on a Sunday morning which they advertised. 
-2	 We were eating before a 1.30pm show at the NIA and found that lots of restaurants/pubs didn't serve food until 12.30 which would be too late for us, so the Pitcher and Piano seemed perfect. We placed our order at 11.50 when it seemed that only a handful of tables were occupied. At 12.20 we politely asked the waitress to see how long our meal would be, pointing out that we were seeing a show, but she didn't come back. We asked again five minutes later and our food finally arrived. She asked if we would like another drink, but they didn't arrive until my husband had finished his meal! The only thing that arrived quickly was the bill. The food was lovely, but the experience was stressful and the customer service was extremely poor. 
-2	 We stayed four nights at the Premier Inn next door and having sampled the &quot;delights&quot; of this establishment on a previous trip 4 years ago and having read the recent reviews we declined to eat here again. We did however go for drinks to pass an hour or two on the dark winter evenings. We sat in the bar where were people were also eating. This is not a large area and on one occasion we noticed three tables remaining uncleared for 30 minutes at least. They were not overly busy, but people were looking for seats in the bar and presumably a clean table not one littered with plates of left over food.  Are they understaffed or can they not be bothered - either way this restaurant lets the Premier Inn down. 
-2	Agree with previous reviews- HUGE decline in standards. The food was awful, but the price tag is still up there. We had a basic steak, harvester style dressings with grilled tomato and mushroom on the side- couldn't be further from fine dining- I could have cooked it myself in my tiny kitchen at home. We paid £55 for that steak. Avoid Edge, the only good thing is the view. Utterly dissapointing.
-2	 They advertised they had a new menu which to be honest was no different but they had removed some of the meals from the two for £10 when ordering I didn't think the meal was that nice I had the parmo and my husband had the gammon and to be honest I could have stayed at home and cooked tastier food even my children weren't impressed with the pizza they got everything just tasted like a frozen microwave meal will not be going back 
-2	 Dont complain about cold food YOU WILL BE BANNED by a grumpy manager, who obviously doesnt like complaints 
-2	 We ate here for a late Sunday lunch 2.11.14 to celebrate 2 family birthdays. Although the food was good, the service was terrible. The waitress obviously new took ages to take the order, we had at least a 40 min wait between courses and with twins under 3, who got fed up after a 3 hour wait on 2 courses, we decided to abandon dessert. We had finished up drinks and not offered any more during the meal and trying to get anyone's attention was impossible. Considering the bill was over £200, we were not impressed. I spoke to the manager on the way out as being a regular diner here, was completely shocked at our experience on this occasion. He just said that they had 2 members of staff call in sick but he wasn't aware that it was affecting service. I said that it had ruined our birthday celebration and all he did was say sorry - no offer of a reduction on the bill! Astounded. Will not be going back! 
-2	 I have been to this pub for lunch about ten times, it's usually a very good experience. However I must say the experience I have just had was pretty disappointing. Our party arrived and asked if they had a table for three, we just received a nod from the barman, so we ordered our drinks, and went and sat at one of the free tables. After about twenty minutes of being completely ignored by the waitress and barman, I went to the bar to order our food. After another half an hour we received our sandwiches and side orders of chips, which were, as usual, very tasty. However no idea why we had to wait quite so long, they weren't particularly busy and by this time a third member of staff was around to serve the customers. We were planning on having a dessert but after the lengthy wait for the main course we couldn't be bothered, perhaps the lethargy of the staff had rubbed off on us! We weren't approached by the staff to enquire if our food was ok, or whether we wanted any desserts or coffee, so we just paid and left. With an abundance of lovely pubs in the area- for example the pubs in Stoke Doyle and Titchmarsh, we won't be coming back here for a while! 
-2	 I have been here a few times over the past 6 months, and tend to agree with the poor reviews posted. It really is a pity to see a place once so good, now just the same as any other Chef and Brewer.  The manufactured response from the management is always exactly the same &quot;Thank you for your recent review on Trip Advisor. Your feedback regarding your recent visit was a concern to hear and I would like to investigate these comments further with the Management Team of the pub. I have sent you a direct message to discuss this further and look forward to hearing from you soon.  Kind Regards Chef & Brewer&quot; I am wondering why there is still no improvement? 
-2	 Slow service, average food, rude and unfriendly staff who don't have the time of day for young children.  Repeatedly ignored my 3 year old daughter who was simply trying to ask for a balloon. I asked the manager in the end who kindly got her one. Filthy toilets.  Angry chef getting humpy and rude with the waitress, in front of customers. Very unprofessional.  Wouldn't recommend dining here and i won't be returning.   
-2	 My friend and I went here last night for ladies night. It wasn't busy. However we were sat at a table near the window and then the lady brought us the menu over and some water. They came back again took our drinks order we ordered two Strawberry mojito as it was 2 4 1 on cocktails we were wondering how long out drinks were going to be as 10 mins later still no drinks and there was not many in at all 3 tables I think and a few loud men stood at the bar. the drinks arrived 25 mins after we had ordered them there was no communication as to why there was a wait only thing I can think of was they had to nip sainsbury to get ingredients.   They had a live singer in and he was good very good.   Food was OK but wouldn't say it was contempary food. Although was nicely presented and looked good.   Doubt we will be returning again.    
-2	 Visited Marco's in sheffield for lunch on a Sunday. On arrival the decor looked very nice which made me feel I was going to enjoy my lunch, nice lady greeted us and took us to a table which was set up for 6 places (there was 3 of us dining). Only one other table occupied in the restaurant, a table for two. So there were plenty of other tables to sit us at ie a table for four would have been better. We sat down and then the other half of the table was cleared off all cutlery, glasses etc, it now started to look bare. We were given our menus and then a waiter came and asked us what we would like to drink, he then cleared our side plates and wine glasses the only items on the table now we're our knives and forks, I thought this very unusual,he brought our drinks and then I asked him why he cleared the plates and cutlery, he replied to give us more space. I was a bit perplexed as we were 3 people sat at a table for 6!!! I asked for the plates back as he didn't know what we would be ordering, he went ok have them back and then just plonked them on the table. Our food order taken, I had asked for some bread but the menu didn't say there was any dipping oil, so asked the waiter if there was any he said no, I know I'm being fussy over this but I ask you an Italian restaurant without any oil and Marco Pierre Whites restaurant at that.  Our food arrived, basically it was garlic bread which was ok. My main course was pasta and meatballs which again was ok, meatballs a bit hard and dry. I don't think I would visit again unless there was a big improvement in the food and the attitude of one member of staff, although the decor was nice the room was very cold. It was a bit of a let down when you think you're going into something that will be special but overall it's not and its such a shame, Sheffield needs something like that. If I were Marco Pierre White I wouldn't be happy with the food they served. 
-2	 Unfortunately, the Joshua Bradley has lost what it used to be. The quality of the food had been lost completely which is a huge shame considering its location & great opportunity for 'local produce'. The staff don't seem to have an idea of customer service anymore, from little things like a simple 'hello' on arrival to checking everything is ok or reordering drinks. Such a shame as this used to be a great place. 
-2	This place should be called &quot;Average Joe&quot; as the food, service and the decor isn't anything special. The quality and freshness of food is questionable. We will not be going back.
-2	Visited on a Friday afternoon - was advised wait for food would be at least 40 minutes although not full. Wish we hadn't bothered - tapas served wasn't as good as Iceland £1 party food- was burnt, over salted and inedible! Cocktails good but do not go if you want to eat - we won't be back!
-2	 Stopped in to grab a quick lunch on the way to the station.  Service was very slow and aloof even though the place was pretty empty.   We got a panini and a baguette with tea.  The tea was actually cold and we had to dump it.  The food was average nothing special. 
-2	 Great place to sit and drink but that's about it. Poor service, long queues, cold food that at best was average - ordered a hot sandwich which was over-priced and disappointing and not good value for money either. Pop in for a drink with friends but eat elsewhere. 
-2	 Went to TGI's for my brothers birthday, and it was appalling. We ordered Jack Daniels Sesame Strips to start, there were about 5 per plate, for the amount they cost the quantity was ridiculous! I ordered a chicken salad, and everyone else in my family ordered a basic burger. The portion of fries on one of the plates wouldn't even be enough for a child. The food was cold and took an hour to arrive.... An hour! How long does it take to make a salad? The chicken in my salad was burnt, and the leaves were warm. For a table of six, costing around £200 (which also took them 20 minutes to accept a card payment) is totally overpriced and appalling. NEVER AGAIN!! 
-2	Visited for the first time at the weekend and was very disappointed. We each had the all you can eat carvery as it was only sold as all you can eat, after one plate full i wouldn't have wanted more. The food was cold even Yorkshire puddings that had been brought out 'fresh'. I would find it hard to believe the stuffing had not been there all day as it was dry and hard. In future we will be sticking to fish and chips when we visit Cleethorpes.
-2	 I have eaten in this restaurant many times . The food has always been good , but in the recent Time the quality of the food has been going down the Hill the Service had always been good but .. i Wish they would do something About the food consistancy.one week hot next runny mild get you act together before you feel the pinch  
-2	I went here for a breakfast meeting this morning and first impressions were great. You immediately feel the expensive vibe.  There were to be 6 of us, sat at a 12 seater table! Which would have looked ridiculous. We asked them to remove the chairs and cutlery before our guests arrived. This was quite awkward watching one lady do it by herself whilst other members of staff were looking around for things to do!  It was particularly poor service - extremely slow and rude.  3 breakfasts arrived, 5 minutes later the rest did.   I ordered baked beans with my ridiculously overpriced and cold full English (which by the way says sausages and you only get 1! Same with breakfast potatoes) and the beans turned up as I finished my meal after asking twice for them).  The blonde female waitress needs lessons on how to smile and how to walk without stomping.  So for the price you expect a hell of a lot more. It's such a shame as this place has the perfect location!
-2	 Cant really comment on the food on this occasion as we were ignored on several occasions having come in from a very wet and windy day, Two tables on either side of us were served and not once were we offered a menu or acknowledged. after 10 minutes we left. 
-2	 Oh dear !Whilst an obviously amazing location and ambient interior we were yet against let down by the quality of overpriced food, so much so that my husband has stated that despite its convenient location relative to where we live he will never return. I cannot fault the service and the Bon ami but the food can be lack lustre, on my previous visit I was given a very shabby steak and the maitre d knocked 50 percent off my bill as it was clear that it was inedible. I will now have to always go to the royal William yard , Yealmpton or Noss Mayo for a good restaurant meal 
-2	 A lukewarm welcome for ten people on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Firstly, only one beer available on tap; secondly a refusal to serve a half of Guiness; thirdly a debit card declined for drinks. If the management of this pub does not wish to serve drinkers they should make it clear they are only interested in the restaurant trade. 
-2	I have given the Pipe and slippers 2 stars only because the staff were helpful and friendly. The food was simply dreadful and we ended up leaving it. There were only sandwiches on the menu and I ordered Halloumi which was ok , and my husband ordered steak and bacon which looked like minced cat food with a bit of dried streaky bacon on the top. Both had a lot of spinach greens as a salad inside. Our hand cut chips were greasy, limp and inedible. It seemed as though they had been cooked in oil that hadn't reached the right temperature. It wasn't cheap either and I have had far better from a van at the side of a layby. It looks a good drinking pub and good for socializing, but I would advise against eating there.
-2	Our table wasn't ready so we sat at the bar to order drinks. They had 'run out' of all reasonably priced drinks, which is surprising given we went on a Tuesday! Decor is beautiful but that's where it ends. Food was mediocre, service was terrible, although there were many many waiters but they all seemed to be moving around doing nothing! Singing was good but no dance floor and no dancing. The price: £140.00 per person! Definitely wouldn't go back!
-2	Stayed overnight on a 'deal' where we could either choose from a set menu or have a £25 allowance off the main menu. My husband had a steak which was very nicely cooked, half a tomatoe, half a mushroom and a few chips We were over two hours having dinner, service was appaling, there seemed to be lots of staff but we even had to wait 2o mins for the desert menu. When we complained, us and other diners were told that they were very busy as there was a wedding on, no excuse, the hotel should allow for that or at least tell us that there will be a delay. Would not eat there again.
-2	 On each Sunday visit to the cafe there has been one young girl serving while 4 or 5 other staff are out the back in the kitchen. They ignore the long queue while trying to look busy. Several people walk away. The service is dreadful. Customers pointed out the fly on the food in the chiller. It's a shame because it could be good but needs managing properly. 
-2	 We visited Mumbai Blue on Saturday 2nd August and was sadly disappointed with all of our meals. Yes it is great that you can bring your own alcoholic drinks, however the watery curries with no spice or seasoning leave a lot to be desired. The Dopiaza tasted exactly the same as the Bhuna and the Jalong curry except extra chilli powder added to the Jalong. We have visited numerous curry houses throughout the East and West Midlands and Mumbai Blue is nowhere near as good. The atmosphere was non existent and was very quiet I guess due to the location next to a petrol station. If you are looking for a decent curry in the Coventry/Warwickshire area then try 'The Mint' or 'Castle Balti' as you can take your own drinks to both of these curry houses and the food is so much better. Sorry Mumbai Blue but the curries fell short of restaurant quality. 
-2	 Waited for ever for food, when it arrived it was lukewarm, portion tiny, Does not live up to expectations. 
-2	 We visited the Fleece for dinner on Sat evening. Although the food itself was very tasty, both my partner and I sent our food back as the food was cold! The second meal given to me was hot but again my partners wasn't hot enough. A shame as ambience was lovely, real fire, comfy chairs, enough people for an atmosphere but not too busy.  
-2	 4 drinks cost me £20! The chairs were dirty and uncomfortable, it was cold and the toilets were absolutely disgusting, urine and toilet paper all over the floor and broken locks on the doors ( this was the ladies ) I won't be going here again. 
-2	 Came here on a Monday night and was disappointed with the standard of food, was certainly not fresh and felt like mass produced food. Also was then very shocked to be charged with a £9.50 bill for one glass of wine! Will not be coming again. 
-2	 This restaurant used to be one of our favourites in York and indeed we went there for Christmas Day 2012 and had a fabulous day with wonderful food. All I can say is WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE?  Christmas Day this year (2013) was an experience I would not wish to repeat. The food was what I can only describe as canteen like, cold and uninspiring. The vegetables were awful. Carrots were just boiled and dry and as they had been described on the menu as &quot;honey roasted&quot;, I can only think that the honey had either been forgotten or chef (a loose term for him/her) had run out. As for the sprouts, I am a lover of al dente vegetables but these were only a little beyond uncooked!  I could go on but would have to comment on every item on the menu which would just be boring. Suffice to say, avoid this restaurant at all costs. We will not be returning, which on reflection is a shame as this place was always a joy to visit in the past. Management need to take a close look at what is going on in the kitchen! 
-2	 Went to Bill's as we thought it had good reputation. Atmosphere and music was nice but the food was dry and very bland. Overall we were disappointed and annoyed at spending £50 on this meal as eating out is a treat for us. 
-2	 I have been here a few times and it has always been hit a miss with food and staff. My partner had some mussels here which turned out to be revolting with quite a few bad mussels in there , and my steak was thin and tough as a old boot, half of it was fat. We did complain and their response was average for a complaint, the waiter seemed like he didn't really care. But they did replace our food and it was ok, just a standard meal, nothing that amazed us. As for the staff, I agree with a previous review about short skirts and buttons undone, too much flesh on show and a certain attitude amongst the staff which really is a put off, also the waiter was painful to watch as he was so slow and unenthusiastic. I will not return to this restaurant again, there are too many good restaurants in the old town that are well worth going to. 
-2	 It pains me to say this as I do love Velvet as a Hotel. The rooms are flawless, beautifully designed and clean and the breakfast is also delicious. However, I have to say the restaurant food is below average and if it wasn't for the fact that they were offering 50% off I would have refused to pay for my meal. I went with my girlfriend on a Sunday spontaneously and I won't be making the same mistake again. I ordered the King Prawns with chill and garlic (originally supposed to be £7.95) Do not order these! The prawns are tiny, there's nothing King about them! They're low quality and looked like something you'd expect in a Weatherspoons, not a nice establishment like Velvet. The bread they serve with the prawns is half a floured bap cut in half, which does not complement the prawns at all and seemed like they had ran out of the actual bread they are suppose to serve this with (If that isn't the case and that is the bread you usually serve with the prawns I would have a quiet word with the chef if I was management) For £8 you'd expect a lot nicer but as I said, it was 50% off so I didn't bother complaining. The fries are nice and i also got pitta bread and humous which, you can't really ever go wrong with but everything came rather lukewarm, even my girlfriends Steak. The Steak was cooked to perfection but it lacked flavour and if I was to pay the full price for it, I would not be happy but again because of the 50% off offer, there was no need. In my opinion there are much nicer, cheaper places to go in Manchester with a much higher quality of food. It seems to me its quite a hit and miss place, maybe other dishes are very nice and considering the overall quite positive reviews i've read, I'd assume some menu items must be nice however, what we ordered was really not. If you don't have high expectations and you want a cheap meal then go and take advantage of the 50% off offer which is running at the moment but I personally wouldn't go and pay full price for what I got and I probably won't be returning to the restaurant again. Really disappointing. 
-2	It seems that the new management's ethos for a successful business is to charge more, for less. I ordered chips and gravy at lunch to takeaway. £2.15 later, I have a tiny sized portion of see-through chips (which I waited for as a 'fresh batch' was coming) swimming in thin, tasteless gravy. Shocking!!
-2	 Went to The Cross for our works Christmas meal. We had pre ordered our meals before arrival. When we arrived we were told there was going to be at least an hours wait on the food. We understood there had been someone not show up in the kitchen, we accepted this. However, the restaurant wasn't busy the bar wasn't particularly busy and there were 4 staff front of house. When our starters eventually arrived, they were &quot;okay&quot; however it took 30 minutes and my colleague prompting someone to take away our plates when the staff were all congregating by the kitchen. Main courses again food was average and took again a lengthy time and prompting for the table to be cleared. The Desert was overall poor, one colleague found their Christmas pudding to be inedible and my ice cream sundae lacked a key ingredient but did taste okay. Overall, this was my first and last visit, and it is a shame as it is quite local to my workplace. 
-2	 It had been 28 years since we held our wedding reception at this quaint hotel and thought it might be nice to celebrate our anniversary with a couple of drinks and a nice meal on a Friday evening. We didn't make a reservation and as it happens we certainly wouldn't have needed to... the bar had one group of about 6 guests who were obviously staying at the hotel and that was it. We were greeted welcomingly enough but with no atmosphere in the bar or the restaurant it felt cold and lacking which did not entice us to stop for a meal. Very sad. 
-2	 I was impressed when it first opened, returned last week and disappointed. Had to wait to have our order taken although the restaurant was half empty. No sparking water of any description and no offer by the waiter to get some despite there being two supermarkets with a one minute walk. One of us had stuffed peppers which had been overcooked and were just a soggy mess. Should have sent it back really but we didn’t. Wouldn’t return in a hurry as there are plenty of good eating places in the area. 
-2	 Normally a regular customer or kabana ... Good has slowly been going down hill. Ordered a lot of food and put the yogurt sauce all over it to find out that it was sour, chalky and had a after taste of vomit ... The manager was very rude on the phone saying he had made it today and it can't go off mean while mine was curdling in my plate... He did not want to listen to anything we has to say and he put the phone down on us, saying we was not getting back a refund either .. Very upsetting NEVER going back there again. 
-2	 Not impressed at all,we were a party of 10, food took a long time to appear, 1 Lasagne was so well done needed hammer and chisel, had to go back. Chips were cold, 1 dinner did arrive, as waitress did not check amount of meals ordered. Prices were not cheap given bulk standard fayre. Tables were just bare wood. I WOULD NOT CALL THIS A RESTAURANT its the old public bar converted with no atmosphere, would have been better off going across the road for fish and chips. Not sure what other reviewers normally eat, but if they think this is good, they are obviously not used to having decent home cooked meals. Following the meal, half of the party including the children had a stomach upset, I rest my case. . 
-2	 Myself and my partner visited here yesterday evening as we wanted to try somewhere new on the dock and had heard some good reviews from friends.  Firstly we were seated by a nice young lady who stated our waitress would soon be over. Our waitress known as Hannah came along to take out drinks orders. We ordered the cosmopolitan and berry Mojito. Minutes later she came back to say there was no purée, we then changed our drinks order to something else. She came back over to state that the bar man was making the first cocktails we had ordered. This wasn't a very good start but we weren't too phased. We ordered our main dishes and I had accidentally ordered the lamb instead of the steak. When I realised this I immediately called her over, apologised and asked if I could change my order. She then replied 'Only if he hasn't started cooking it!' My partner is the manager of a restaurant and said that is not the case. The waitress seemed to have no idea. She then said she would discuss it with her manager. I then wanted to leave at that point. Her manager said it was not a problem. After being seated 15-20 minutes later. My partner asked to check on our drinks order. She then said 'They are made downstairs.' Extremely rude. She then walked over to the corner and we knew she was talking about us to other staff members. The manager then brought our drinks order over, he was extremely polite and professional.  Our food arrived some while later, it was outstanding. It's a shame that we felt so uncomfortable the whole time we were there.  This girl had no customer service skills, she didn't smile once, we could tell she didn't want to come near our table and we were extremely polite to her the whole time. She most certainly should not be working in that type of environment and has no idea how to deal with customers. We were going to stay for drinks but decided to leave as soon as we'd eaten. She ruined our whole experience and for that reason, we will never be back here. 
-2	Seriously disappointed with this restaurant. Love middle eastern food and shisha but this place is such a rip off it should be a crime. £40 for shisha limited to 1 hour and a minimum cover charge for drinks is ridiculous. We sat down ready to order only to be told these terms and conditions in such a rude manner, that we left. Do yourself a favour and skip the pomp and ceremony and go to Edgware Road. Same if not better food & shisha at a fraction of the price.
-2	 The restaurant is beautiful inside and has a lovely atmosphere. I ordered the chicken and mushroom pasta but was disappointed that eventually realised my chicken was off and not very tasty at all. My meal was warm not hot which was the same with the other dishes ordered too. Despite this the waiters were very nice about it and did not charge me for the meal. If you go here maybe order a pizza as these looked nice. 
-2	 Visited as a last resort as most other places were packed out. Restaurant could have done with someone   taking a brush over the floor. Service was ok but food wasn't. Chips looked like they'd been fried several times, burger was overcooked and not of particularly good quality meat. When we paid, waiter assumed I wanted to  use my card contactless and swiped it without asking. Sharp practice me thinks. Wouldn't recommend eating here.         
-2	 I visited here with my husband and son Though the waitresses were very attentive, was this because there wasn't many people in the restaurant - which makes the next bit even worse. It took half an hour to receive our food only had scampi and a burger how long does that take to cook The hot food was nice, though my son`s burger didn't look too appetising I was very annoyed that I had to ask numerous times for the salad cart and rolls to be filled up as there was hardly anything on the salad cart  The waitresses that were standing around could have surly filled up the salad cart ???? Ice cream - in knicker blocker glory was half melted and I think I counted one section of strawberry was mostly pineapple (one of the only things that was on the salad cart)   I have come here numerous of times and this is the worst I have ever experienced, I shall think twice before coming here again 
-2	 Very slow service, forgot our drinks order and food was at a very average level, lacking in excitement or flavour. This may have been more understandable if the restaurant was busy, however it was at the beginning of the season, with only two other small groups in the restaurant. 
-2	 Had a breakfast for the first time in the revamped Cafe. Not great - tinned tomatoes, warm sausage that looked hardly cooked. They really do seem to give you the cheapest and minimum they have too which is disappointing since a supermarket is just below! No mushrooms or black pudding. Really tasteless. Won't go again, would rather pay more somewhere else. Was better before the revamp. 
-2	 My husband and I ate here as we were on our way to the gym in Bury on Saturday morning. We went in as we had a bit more time before gym class starts and the breakfast people were eating looked very good.    We ordered breakfast and they were ok. The presentation is done really well and made the food look more posh than a regular breakfast plate. It wasn't at all expensive when you Base the price on the presentation and location of the cafe. The food we had was average and not at all special.  The lady that served us that morning didn't make it feel welcome. I'm not sure what it was, it could be because we weren't dressed to impress as we were in our pre-gym clothes that she was a bit abrasive and unwelcoming. We say this because when other people walked in and sat down she was totally different towards them.  I'm not saying don't go there as the food was okay and it may even be better when you visit. We are just sharing our opinion of our visit.  To end this review, it is very unlikely for us to go back. 
-2	 I shall try to be fair on my review as it was not too bad. Greeted very nicely, sat 4 of us on a table up stairs, it was a busy Saturday evening. Took order and drinks order (but one small glass of water) and two bottles of cobra and never got another drink . The pickle tray was minute not enough for 4 adults. The starter was nice prawns lamb chops and a mixed grill that we all shared. The main came out a bit too quickly for my liking as it was busy and we expected to wait at lot longer for it. The korma was ok,was expecting it to be better. Rogan josh was more like a buna just tomatoes, and not much else .The lamb curry was awful and looked it as well. The bowl was cold and it was luke warm and just tasted of salt it was left un eaten, I felt it was someones left overs it looked and tasted that bad.The service was terrible no member of staff looked happy to be at work, We asked for bill £121.50 and sat at table waiting for them to collect it, after half hour I got someones attention and asked for wipes to clean our hands, took the bill to the bar as Ididn,t want anyone to make off with the cash. Never again will we go here I went home and made a sandwich and went to bed. 
-2	 Went for a weekend in bakewell with family and was looking for an indian restaurant. Found this one on the web site and chose it because of the good reveiws. Inside was lovely,staff were polite and helpful. But the food was very dissapointing. the rogan josh wasn,t spicy, it was bland. And the lamb passanda was disgusting, no taste what so ever. It was slop! I doubt very much that the person who cooked it would eat it themselves nor the staff. Thank god I enjoyed the poppudoms and pickle tray! If you are the type of person that likes spicy,tasty food and have lots of experience dining at indian restaurants. Then please do not go here, because you will be very dissapointed. Nice decor, rubbish food. Della B. Sheffield 
-2	I came in here with a friend today as we assumed with Costa next door for competition, this cafe would go out of their way to be friendly and provide good service.  Wow was I wrong.  We were checking out the drinks and the muffins, etc, there was no one else behind us waiting to be served and I said just a moment please, I haven't been here before and want to see what there is. Once I ordered he looked at my friend and said, and you? When she said she hadn't decided yet this man tutted at us and shook his head. I actually could not believe he had done that. Surely you want a customer to order something they want? Especially if there's no need to hurry.  I had a bounty coconut muffin which was amazing! My friend said she enjoyed her smoothie.   However, the staff were incredibly slow, rude and clearly were not in the least bit interested in their customers. It is almost hilarious that they wear t-shirts saying 'great service' on the back.   No one asked me about a loyalty card, neither if I had or wanted one, and it wasn't until I sat down that I saw a poster saying 'loyalty card? your first coffee is on us!'. So of course, I was quite annoyed that no one had offered.  I haven't experienced such poor service in a long time and I can now fully understand why the costa next door was so busy.  I wouldn't recommend this cafe to a friend and I certainly won't be going back.
-2	 Went for Sunday dinner to try somewhere new in Didsbury. We didn't realise it was Greek due to the name. The meat was cooked well and the veg was adequate and an odd selection for a Sunday dinner. The mushroom starter is something to stay away from. If you go, it's probably best to try one of their specialities 
-2	 We stopped into this place on a Thur night hoping for a nice meal & a catchup. The ambience was lovely, candlelit French cave style.  Unfortunately it went downhill from there. We both ordered the fillet steak, to be medium/well-done, i.e. not bloody but still juicy. Maybe there was some misunderstanding, but the steaks we got were dried out & gristly, NOT worth £18. The spinach also was disappointing, just a bowl of overly wilted leaves with absolutely no dressing. We both left half our meals & tried for dessert to stave our hunger. Chocolate mousse that tasted like Cadburys but thicker. Fine enough to eat but not of a standard I would expect.  Overall a very disappointing meal & even more annoying at a total of £70... service was added of course! 
-2	 came here a couple of weeks ago with my fiance, after hearing so many great things about it, but i just found it really sloppy, the chips was re-fried and cold/hard. maybe just went at a bad time. 
-2	 Six of us visited in January. Four of us were unwell during the night/ next day. The three men had thought the beer tasted off but I had no beer and was very sick. The starters were a disappointment. We ordered the seafood sharing platter but were surprised to find that most of the items were fried and therefore not very healthy. The main courses were o k ish but unspectacular and the desserts were very ordinary. We felt that there was an attempt to be gimmicky by taking a twist on traditional food but that it didn't come off e. g the fruit crumble which was cold and bland. This is a pity as we had high expectations for this restaurant with its links to H F Whittingstall. 
-2	 Visited a while ago with friends having already visited the original Craft Bar at the Salisbury Arms and wanted to see what the hype was about! The bar looks fantastic and I was particularly taken with the beautiful tiling around the floor. Apart from this the whole experience was a bit on a let down which as a shame. They seem to be going for a bit of a diner theme upstairs with uncomfortable seating and knives and forks already out on all the tables which never strikes me as particularly hygienic. We ordered two burgers with halloumi and a hot dog. Unfortunately when the burgers arrived only one had halloumi but the waitress insisted we hadn't ordered two and that we were mistaken. After some debate with the waitress she offered to get another with halloumi but that there would be a wait as there were other orders in. My friend offered to just take the one he hadn't ordered because we were strapped for time. He made a (half!) joke about maybe having a beer for the trouble which is probably the least she could do but the waitress just laughed and walked off. The bread was dry and falling apart, which from experience means it is pre-bought frozen bread and not fresh. I would give this place a lower review but they are new and it is perhaps teething problems, I think they may have the potential to improve. 
-2	 Came here on Saturday whilst on a night out with colleagues. The bar was nicely furnished and initially the place seemed nice. I ordered 3 double vodka + cokes and a glass of wine. We saw the bar person make our drinks and it was evident they were singles however when we asked her she denied this and continued to charge us for doubles (over £25 for 4 drinks) which was infuriating to say the least. Needless to say we only stayed for one before moving onto a bar where you actually receive what you order and pay for! 
-2	 This is the 2nd time I have had food from the cafe here and I can honestly say I will never eat here again as it was just as bad the 2nd time. On this occassion I ordered Scrambled eggs and bacon on toast, a safe bet I thought as who cant get this right? How wrong I was, im pretty sure the egg was microwaved and it made the 'toast' turn to mush and I literally could not eat it it was that disgusting. The simple solution to the problem is to put the items separately on the plate, not worth the £3.20 I paid at all. Ive had better scrambled eggs on toaat in Thailand which was much cheaper. I also felt sorry for one of the young girls behind the counter who seemed to be being talked to like dirt by the other girls who worked there, all while me and my friend were there in front of them. 
-2	 You can't really judge a franchise on the food because it is pretty much standard across the board.  What you can judge them on is service and this is what is lacking here at the Gallions Reach branch. 
-2	I went for the first time with a friend and I ordered the japchae with rice whilst my friend ordered the seafood ramen. The ramen used just miso soup as the soup base so wasn't that special. My dish was worse. the rice was too dry and the beef in the chapjae was soo dry it felt like i was eating beef jerkys. The noodles for my japchae were nice and the veggies, that was it.
-2	I have been to Cosmo several times and have always enjoyed the quality of the food and service. So mch so, that, having moved to Kent, I decided to make the hour's journey back to Croydon to take my friend out for dinner there. The 1 hour 45 minutes time limit starts from the time you have booked the table from, regardless of if you are at your table at that time or not - we were not seated until 6.50, 20 minutes after our booking time! When we were taken to the section we were due to sit at, another member of staff took their clients to the booth we were about to sit at and we were taken to the smallest table possible, cramped against the wall and mere centimetres away from the table next to us - they may as well have put our tables together the amount of space we had!  Not to be put off, we then went to the food area - no plates!!! All the cooking stations they have available and there was not one plate to be seen! When the plates DID come out there were so many people waiting that there was a bundle for them... The one saving grace is that the food once we DID get a plate was good... not the usual fantastic standard but edible. We moved on to dessert and the Eton Mess and Profiteroles had not been replenished, there were just empty bowls. Once they WERE replenished, guess what? No spoons to eat with... I fail to see how, on a Saturday night, a place that is normally so good drops it's standards so badly - and feels justified in charging the extortionate bar prices they do, particularly when the bar area is a free for all too!!!  I expressed my concerns to the restaurant directly on Monday and have had no response. Poor effort Cosmo, poor effort.
-2	 I am really sorry to have to write this review but feel I have to express the disappointment we experienced. My friend and I have been visiting Mad Jacks for the last couple of months meeting once every 3-4 weeks. Up to today we have been more than satisfied but unfortunately today it was not up to expectations. The menu was changed fair comment as it is now spring but not for the better. If you like fish or vegetarian you may be quite satisfied. But for a meat eater not much choice. We had the black pudding starter and could tell from the moment we were served could tell the difference in presentation from previous visits. Because of lack of inspiration on the mains we went for the sharing board of meats but again found this disappointing. Could not fault the staff though he was very attentive and pleasant. Not sure if they have changed the chef or not but if so please bring back the old one. May be a while now before we go back and have to change our venue. Sorry but not up to usual standards. 
-2	 We visited after seeing good reviews on this site but were very disappointed, the food was very basic but overpriced. They use exotic meats for a 'wow factor' but they are poorly accompanied with terrible chips and badly prepared veg and are incredibly expensive. Overall poor food. 
-2	 Heard numerous good things about this restaurant so I was excited to try it out for myself but I personally found the food to be quite bland and tasteless :( May have come on an off night. The bruschetta starter was definitely the highlight of the whole meal. 
-2	 last year we enjoyed many beautiful meals here and have recommended to lots of people,sadly we will never recommend again,the meals were very poor and the service was even poorer,I have no idea what has happend but can only say we won`t be back even after complaining we were told please come back but no explanation was given apart from the fact of them having new staff,I only wish I had read the two other comments before booking. 
-2	 I just popped in to have a coffee and the place was still being cleaned and the staff looked miserable and unfriendly. The phones were constantly ringing too. Maybe it takes time to liven up, why open the doors if you're not ready for custom? Oh and the coffee tasted disgusting - ended up leaving it and no one seemed to care!! Won't go there again for a morning treat... 
-2	 I walk past this place everyday and was really looking forward to taking my parents there for dinner. We went there this evening and was very disappointed with both the service and food. I booked three days before and requested a table outside - when we arrived we asked if we could sit outside, we were told there were no tables outside despite there being two free tables outside...we pointed this out and the man who I think was the manager said &quot;oh yeah&quot; and let us put the two small tables together OURSELVES. Our waiter really looked like he wanted to be anywhere but serving our table and did everything extremely slowly.   My mum had the starter special of scallops, which was actually quite nice, and my dad had the squid, which was very oily and a very small portion considering the price. I had the seafood bisque which was really not nice at all. It tasted of nothing at all and I actually left most of the bowl.  For mains, my dad has the surf and turf (pork belly and scallops) and found it very dry and tasteless, with the pork belly very fatty. My mum and I both had the sea bass which was literally two pieces of dry and plain sea bass with a bit of mash potato and plain wilted spinach. Considering both mains were around £19 I thought they were all a complete rip off.  The only enjoyable part of the meal was the profiterole cheesecake my dad had at the end, which was quite nice.  Overall, very disappointed - we actually refused to pay the service charge it was so bad! Our waiter seemed to disappear completely after our dessert so we were left outside waiting for the bill for almost an hour!  Not good. 
-2	 I visited pieros with my 7 year old daughter and her best friend , I ordered a childs cheese and tomato pizza, and a chicken nugget meal and for myself a sea food linguine.  An adult margarita was presented instead of the kids pizza I had ordered ( the response being 'it only 50p difference!' ) the chicken nugget meal was fine , the sea food linguine was absolutely terrible the sauce barely existed it was sticky and dry with no taste , the seafood was small frozen prawns a few mussels, it was edible. The service seemed tired and disengaged no one cared to ask if we enjoyed our meals ( I can see why ) over all disappointing this place is so unpredictable I have had great meals in the passed but won't risk it again 
-2	 . No acknowledgement of our presence despite standing right in the middle of the 1st floor restaurant and obviously hoping for attention and a table . We were told by the Manager that there was no table for us 5 so we had to suggest to clear 2 tables and put them together so we could finally sit down. . Long wait to get first drinks that arrived in 2 batches . Unpeeled stick of celery with the Bloody Mary . Poached eggs were not poached but boiled! ... and scrambled eggs were dry and overcooked or rather seemed to have been cooked in advance and kept under warming ramp  . Service messy and unprofessional / staff completely un-trained . Even were wondering at one stage if we had to get up to clear our first course dishes as there was such an accumulation of glasses and plates.... . The Manager clearly had not idea she was managing a restaurant and when we complained, the only thing she said is &quot;oh I did not know there were issues!&quot; &gt; isn't it the role of a Manager to be aware?  &gt; Staff absolutely not trained - just having good time on a Saturday job! But who could train them?  Will never waste our money there again A Joke!!!  (from good food lovers who used to run 2 restaurants and 1 deli)  Muriel Chabernaud and Family, London 
-2	 I was taken here by a friend for lunch so it was embarrassing to have such a lacklustre experience.   Firstly the menu; if you don't like fennel or chilli you will have a problem. This was the lunch menu and I don't think it was well balanced. We started with a vegetable platter and a meat platter that we shared. The meats where all fine but no better quality than I can buy in a supermarket, the cheeses where the same. In fact nothing stood out on the starters except the tiny piece of toast with Aubergine tapenade that was tasty. The vegetables, on the other hand, had so much vinegar on them they made me choke.    The mains where the big let down. We both ordered the fish and chips. They came presented on a huge chopping board, too big for the table,with the fish lying on a smear of tartare sauce. As my fish was presented skin side up I tried to turn it over and it fell appart in a soggy mess. Not crisp batter, and with chilli in it, and just not that fresh. Plus my pet hate, reheated chips.  The desert was ok, chocolate brownie with ice cream and caramel popcorn. Very rich, too much for me and my friend but tasty.  The only positive was the friendly and efficient service we received from every member of staff. It's a shame they don't work somewhere better as I would be happy to be served by them again only not there. 
-2	 Went to the tramshed for a birthday dinner and wasn't surprised after the reviews I had already heard about the place.   Although the staff Wernt unfriendly they all lacked big time in actually serving us we had to ask them to take our drinks and order. We Wernt asked how our meal was and Wernt all given glasses for water. Also had to ask for bill no suprise really. They all do a lot of standing around looking but that's it.   Food was average beef was cooked more rare than medium rear which we didn't ask for. you have to Also pay for salad six pounds something for a bowl of romaine lettuce with nothing else apart from dressing in it! Which my partner was furious about.   Overall I think the food tasted ok but the exsperience wasn't a great one I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.   
-2	Tried Monkeys again as it's very convenient to where I usually stay. Sadly no improvement since I stopped going a year ago when they were so appalling. A lot of the food is delicious. So + on that. But you really have to accept that your preferences are not on the menu, you are a peasant and those in charge are the nobs.  SLOW Still extraordinarily slow even if there is only one other table of customers - and a bowl of soup hardly takes long. It's a well known local joke not to go to Monkeys if you're hungry! I suspect the kitchen layout is not good as in a well designed workplace all resources are placed for speed. BREAD FETISH Every dish except desserts is served with a large lump of bread. Not everyone wants a large lump of bread with their intro dish and main dish, or even at all. Some people find bread a bloat, or contra-indicated for weight management. The place sells bread so oerhaps bakes it, but it shouldn't be pushed so hard. It should be offered as an option (but that would take good staff). PUSHY ON ALCOHOL No not everyone wants alcohol especially when in recovery from surgery. Having alcohol choices recited a second time after politely declining and asking for other options is a peculiar thing to do. RUDE & SNOBBY Sigh. No change here. Staff belong to an exclusive club of their own which is way superior to mere clients. It's hard to pin this down so I can't quote or describe exactly, but the attitude is very clear.  Cuisine snobbery can result from being politically correct which could easily apply to Monkeys. I did once suggest to the owner making a small change, which was in a friendly chat until that point. He froze, and said that if people didn't like it at Monkeys they could always go somewhere else. He then turned his back. With that attitude at the top it's not surprising the staff demonstrate that we the public should be grateful to be noticed.  Oh and it would be great to be able tophone earlier to arrange a table, but this isn't reliable as I know from previous experience when I did this but was turned away on arrival.
-2	 New Year's Eve Party in 2015 far superior to what was on offer this time (2016). Management seem to have drastically cut corners re entertainment and buffet. Very little choice at buffet other than curry, curry and more curry. Saw one lady with a plate of roast potatoes as I heard her say she didn't like curry. Desert was a trifle tray bake and more akin to a children's party than a New Year's Eve Party.No entertainment other than a karaoke singer then disco. Although Piper at Midnight was excellent. Last year (2015) there was singers on, a piper at Midnight and a hot and cold buffet with a desert table laden with several deserts on offer - and was £5 cheaper per person than this year! So basically paid £25/person for disco and a curry! Venue literally across the road (Londonderry Hall) had same on offer for half the price. Doubt very much we'll go back for New Year 2017 unless Management get their act together!! 
-2	Used to be regular customers at Oldfields but over the years feel that the food and more particularly the service has become so poor that we no longer visit.
-2	 I can only assume that the previous reviews were written when this place had a chef who knew how to actually cook, seemingly no longer present... unfortunately I believed them when selecting somewhere to grab dinner.  I sensed that I should have left and gone elsewhere when I walked in with my family only to be ignored by the bemused-looking barmaid who seemed eager to find anything else to do other than take our order (the back and forth game of carry the mop to the corner of the bar, look at it, walk back behind bar area, admire mop, back to the corner again, behold mop, back to the bar, be sure to avoid all eye contact with customers, engage contact with mop only, yet not allow the mop to ever make contact with the floor, was highly amusing, but not what we were after when all we wanted was some dinner and a drink).   Unfortunately, I still hoped that this was one of those places that looks poor, but yet holds a tortured genius in the kitchen, simply let down by those who are flummoxed by simple floor-cleaning implements. Alas, this was not the case. 45 minutes later, after having rejected clearly off beer, we were served a buffet of 'straight from the freezer bag into the fryer' foodstuffs. For the price I'd have expected a fish dipped in batter that day, not something pre-processed that could have been bought in Iceland for pennies. Having seen good reviews for the food here, we were all really disappointed.  Safe to say, I'll be going elsewhere in future. 
-2	 Nice venue and the menu looked good. Service was extremely slow but courteous.   When the food eventually arrived it was cold/luke warm at best Although the fish looked good the sauté potatoes were virtually cold and tasted stale, my son's chips were cold and his burger only just warm. We sent the complete order back. Waited again and when the food was brought back (with apologies from the staff for the delay) the potatoes were the same! The plates were cold and although my son now had hot chips his burger was still only just warm. So during the course of approximately 1hr 20mins we only ate a couple of pieces of luke warm sauté potatoes that tasted as though they had been hanging around for ages; we didn't eat the meals.   We decided to give up and bought a sandwhich from the local Tesco store. Such a shame. 
-2	I had lunch with my boss last week. We found the service absolutely terrible. It took them ages to bring us our drinks. In fact they did not bring us our drinks. They left them on the bar until my boss went to get them. The waitress walked off after taking my order for dessert even though my colleague hadn't ordered yet. We had to call her back.  We were too pathetic to query the service charge of 12.5% added automatically. However we did have a go when they tried to add it on again when we were paying by credit card.
-2	 We used to be regular visitors to Meze Mangal but this was our first visit to the 'new improved' version. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed and not wanting to return.  Before, the staff were very attentive but now they seem too busy to cope with the extra business to the point where one staff member in particular was rude when we asked for extra sugar for tea.   Even when we raised the complaint with the owner, he told us that the member of staff was never rude and it must be a.misunderstanding instead of.empathising.  The portion size seems to have shrunk and you no longer get bread or rice with your main meal unless you order it as an extra side dish. Main courses now only come with a spoonful of chopped salad, one of red cabbage and one of grated carrot.  We paid our £30 a head (felt expensive for what we had) and left without being said goodbye to.  Sadly, the restaurant is now bigger but , in my opinion, certainly not better. 
-2	 On a sunny day out my husband and I visited this establishment for a late weekday lunch. The bar is long and I as I have mobility problems, I stood at the closest point on the bar to the front door. I was asked by the barmaid to move roughly six yards along the bar to where she was stood. As every step I take is painful, I left my husband to deal with the drinks ordering and went off to the loo. (There is a restricted mobility WC at ground level which was excellent as the main toilets are upstairs but it would only take a little work, as in altering the taps and bins to make it a good facility for customers with various disabilities.) I returned to find the sparkling mineral water my husband had ordered for me was still water. I took it back to the bar. A barmaid was about to pass me twice before I intercepted her. The water was changed. The menu has a light set menu. I have medical conditions which mean I have certain dietary requirements. I ordered a starter from this menu as a main course. It arrived as a starter. I was still hungry after this small, light salad so tried to order a dessert from this set menu. This was not possible according to the staff as I had not had a starter and main course from the set menu. Offers to pay for that particular dessert (not available on the main dessert menu) at the usual dessert rate were refused. It was not possible. It could not happen. I took the issue up with the Assistant Manager who was as ridiculously inflexible as the general staff. We left, deeply dissatisfied, hungry and bewildered that in this economic climate establishments can behave in this way. Don't go there. With attitudes like this, they don't deserve your custom. 
-2	 Food expensive and very average, we did not stay for dessert as we were disappointed with main meal. Restaurant very shabby and toilets not very clean, but we didn't like the fact that one of the staff had a puppy behind the bar. 
-2	 Went with husband and adult son for a meal. Ordered fish and chips, a chicken dish and steak and ale pie. The pie had been 'nuked' in a microwave. The crust was hard, the contents had solidified/congealed to the point of being inedible and there were only two pieces of meat in it. The fish batter was undercooked as was the fish inside. It appeared to be a square section of frozen fish from a packet that had not been thawed properly before being dropped into the batter. The batter was soggy and unappetising. The chicken meal tasted fine, but the following morning, the result was a severe stomach ache for the consumers of both the fish and the chicken. We complained at the time about the pie - it really was inedible - and the waitress said she would 'mention it to the chef' - what good would that do?? I had been there before, so expected a decent meal. We were disappointed with what was provided and will not be returning. 
-2	 Recommended by a friend. Service quick but not particularly friendly. Cream tea delicious. Panini substandard. Soup overpriced - the bread which came with it was horrible.  The main reason we will not be returning is that a very mild complaint was greeted rather rudely. These ladies don't like criticism. I rather had the impression that the overwhelmingly positive reviews have led the sisters to believe they can do no wrong. In this instance we, the customers, were made to feel embarrassed about a quite legitimate complaint. 
-2	 We stopped here with friends on the weekend for a bite to eat at lunchtime. Chose the venue as they is a variety of choices for any that didn't want a Sunday Roast.  The service was very good, our waitress was very nice, helpful and efficient.  The food on the other hand was awful. Both the roasts which came out were very disappointing. Both the meat (one beef and one pork) looked like we had been served the left over cuts, hardly any on the plate and mostly fat. The cabbage tasted raw and the roast potatoes were hard. The sweet potato fries which came with the Wagyu burgers were cold.  Very disapppointing, walked away still hungry and thinking it was a waste of money as the meals were not cheap. 
-2	 Took a collegue here for eve meal. Service slow, both ordered risotto, 1mushroom, 1squash.. Meals were sloppy and uncooked, thank goodness ordered a garlic bread. Second time have eaten here, and this was their last chance. Will never go again!!!!! 
-2	 Not bad food ,ideal place for a quick snack before you start your shopping .ie soup and sandwich or just a coffee and cake . 
-2	 We had fish and chips from here the fish was nice but the chips were aweful and very expensive. The service was not brilliant really disappointing will not go again 
-2	 We booked a table for for Valentines evening and they only had a table for late lunch time. I thought this was a good sign that the food would be good but the food was terrible! The prices were very high and it simply was not worth it! 
-2	 Well what can I say......disappointing!! Really looking forward to this meal, visited before and enjoyed it, so returned, but never again, staff were rude, no atmosphere, food orders mixed up, meals portion size disguisting......waiting staff didn't seem to have any interest in what they were doing, really sad....I wouldnt advise anyone to come here, I would advise them to go to the pier house down the road, far superior!! 
-2	 Being local I come here regularly. It's location is fabulous and it's a really nice pub/restaurant. I and my family have been here for many celebratory occasions. The staff are friendly and helpful. So what went wrong last Saturday when I brought a guest here for lunch. We ordered a side of sweet potato chips - which were crisp and tasty as they usually are - so why was the portion on my plate soggy, limp and oily. I ordered mushy peas but got ordinary (to be fair, our waitress offered to get the mushy peas when this was pointed out but I didn't accept). The fish, usually really nice came as a crescent shaped arc of batter with a sliver of dried fish. This was sat in a pool of oil. So disappointing when I have had splendid, perfectly cooked fish dishes on other occasions. After several months of top quality food, we clearly are in a down phase right now. My guest had lasagne which looked to me like a ready meal heated in the microwave. I am very much hoping this is a one off but on this Saturday a big disappointment. 
-2	 Went for a meal last evening with my friend and mum. We all decided on Sirloin Steaks. All 3 were cold on arrival, with fat running through. In our opinion they were not Sirloins, more like Rib eye. Very poor and served on cold plates. We did complain and got 15% discount off the bill. Personally we should not have been charged as we brought most of it home for the dog!!! No menus only chalk boards, not good for an elderly lady to have to stand to choose her food having recently had a knee replacement. A place definately to cross of our list. 
-2	 Last year we went to the other Vintage In the Fitzwilliam, so this year as our family get togther 13 in the group we decided on the Cuckoo, on arrival the lobby was full of leaves,as we were early just the 2 of us we went to the bar and waited ages before getting served there was not enough staff behind the bar. On selecting a seat there were heavily stained material cover stools, hard wooden stools, wing backed chairs that were grubby and worn. We were joined by the rest of our group and then we were seated. Some had starters some didn't, then the mains came in the specialty pies by James Martin were served in pots shaped like urns which was appropriate as they were cremated so they were sent back the second attempt came back and one of these was sent back; the chips on another plate were cold, the 'medium' steak was still bloody so it was sent back and was asked if it could be cooked so there was no red or pink when it came back the middle was still rare. The winter greens were hardly cooked at all. The condiment board arrived from the fridge there was three teaspoons of ketch-up which obviously was not enough, the mustard was dried, tired and look unappetizing.  I asked to use the disabled loo and was escorted whilst a member of staff opened the door, once inside whilst the loo was serviceable - but it was not the cleanest, horrid scaly ring around the plug hole which was a dirty brown and obviously not removed for some considerable time, the stainless steel bin was dirty and had not been cleaned that day and you could see where the floor was cleaned over a period of time as by the door and the door frame was a big thick black line of coated in dirt - the loo could do with a deep clean. Whilst the food issues were raised with management and there was a discount given it spoils the event which was celebrating 4 birthdays. Would we return no, are the other reviews correct - in the main yes. Overview - I am sorry to say if I am spending hard earned money on an evening out I expect good service, good food that is hot and cooked and well presented in clean surroundings. Sorry Vintage Inns we will not be coming back. 
-2	 Went here last night as friends who were visiting London wanted to go for Birthday treat. Food uninspiring (three steaks ordered were all overcooked, burger nothing special, salmon and fajitas over spiced), service slow (to the extent that we ordered the next round of drinks as the first ones arrived), one sticky toffee pudding ordered but came as a strawberry ice cream, so everyone else had nearly finished their hot puddings by the time it was rectified. Only plus point was it was a Monday so main courses had a discount and cocktails were half price. Would have been even more unimpressed to have paid full price. Not enough staff on duty. Would not bother to go back or recommend to anyone :( 
-2	Not alot of choice and when the food came it was cold and not much of it. Overpriced for what it was.
-2	 After I read nice reviews we went to Amici on a Saturday evening for a simple meal.  First, we had to wait 10 minutes for our drinks and not even received what we ordered. I believe this happened because our waitress had poor English and she did not understand our questions. We had to ask another 10 minutes later for the rest of the drinks that we ordered at the first place.  After waiting for over 50 minutes for our dishes (2 pizzas and a pasta), we had to send back a side order of chips as it was very soggy. When we were half way through our meal, the manager kindly served another portion of chips that was also very soggy and over salted and not even warm. It seemed like they just mixed it up with some freshly, but also over fried chips. Obviously, we did not eat this portion neither (oil was literally dripping from the chips). We got a wrong dessert served as well...  When I paid the bill, I asked the waitress (who was lovely and willing, but lacking proper training) kindly to remove the chips from our bill as we did not have it because of quality reasons. The manager was next to her and questioned me with a surprised and somewhat angry face. I explained to her the situation and she tried to convince me that it was perfect and it is about my taste. I would have left happily with a simply apology and a promise that she will speak to the chef and double check the matter.  Well, I had dinner with two friends; one of them owes a restaurant and the other one is a general manager in a restaurant, we all agreed that it was a dreadful experience and we would not return which is a shame as we live about 5 minutes away from the restaurant. 
-2	 Visited creams for a cream tea on Friday afternoon, the place looks very nice, but tables are left uncleared. Our scone arrived and we were told to be careful as it was just out of the oven, The outside of the scone was hot and hard and the centre was hard and cold, definitely not fresh. Complained and another scone was brought out which was marginally better. The piano playing was irritating. Won't be back. 
-2	 It's not the worst meal/restaurant I've ever eaten at but it wasn't great and started our first night at the Lake District with a bit of a damper.   The building itself and setting is lovely and it was nice to sit outside and dine al fresco but we believe that the food was overpriced for what they were. My partner ordered the pate for starter and it was very bland and the freshly home baked bread we usually expect with a pate dish at a restaurant was replaced with what was blatantly supermarket sliced bread. Not worth the £5.50. I had a poached pear and blue cheese salad which wasn't very nice to eat. I don't know if it was just the mixture of the food or the way they cooked it but the poached pear was way too sweet and seemed like it was from a can rather than a fresh pear. Everything seemed like it wasn't freshly cooked at the restaurants.  The mains were better with more seasoning and taste to it but by then our spirits were slightly dampened by the starters. Needless to say we didn't order desserts.  The service isn't the best either; we weren't asked for our drinks order (and the don't even have a drinks menu!), we weren't asked how our food was and I saw the waitress lingering about our table, who quickly snapped up our plates up as soon as we put out knifes and fork down, and thus making us feel very rushed out of the place.  Overall, it's okay but way too overpriced for what you get. 
-2	 Visited the restaurant on a a Saturday night (beginning of March) & was expecting great things; notably because of said name attached to the restaurant! What a disappointment.   The restaurant was fully booked & we were seated by the door, underneath the aircon which we had to ask them to turn down as it was freezing. Whilst the decor is suitable, it felt more like being in a function room with the bright lighting & as we were so far away from the main part of the restaurant, we weren't able to soak up any ambiance of the place as a whole.  Orders were taken promptly, questions were asked appropriately. However, we had to ask (several times) for our drinks....then our starters arrived! They then brought the drinks out after the THIRD time of asking. When the main course came one steak was left without a pre-ordered sauce & another steak did not have the greens. On pointing this out (after waiting several minutes to get the staff's attention) they brought the sauce out on the same plate as the greens...even though for two separate customers!  Coffees were ordered & we specifically asked them to come AFTER the desserts. First they arrived BEFORE, then they arrived with, & the 3rd time they arrived whilst we were eating our desserts! All 3 times they arrived by different staff.... what's going on with the communication in your restaurant??  The food was great, it has to be said....although over priced, without a doubt. Even though the staff were friendly enough & apologetic when things were wrong, we had to get their attention & point things out as opposed to them just delivering a good service. Other friends also went to the restaurant on another occasion & had the exact same issues, so it's not a case of complaining for the sake of it. They will lose customers at this rate, unless it's a customer who doesn't expect a certain standard for the money they are paying. I expect Marco Pierre White would be greatly disappointed, seeing as he supposedly prides himself on excellent customer service. 
-2	 Great location. Food just about OK and not expensive but the staff!! Oh goodness brusque to the point of rudeness and not a thankyou or a smile our whole visit. Couple serving at the bar more intent on talking to their friends at the end whilst a queue developed. A shame. Could not recommend this nplace as ther is so much better nearby. 
-2	 After reading positive reviews we decided to pay a visit here. Major disappointment overall. Very slow service, frozen chips heated up, small fillet of chicken hidden under sauce. Uninspiring food and expensive. Will not visit again, not recommended. 
-2	 My boyfriend and I have gone to the Millennium Gallery Cafe a number of times over the last eight years and whilst it might be a little expensive we have always been happy with the food. I had heard it had changed owners earlier this year and when we visited today it was clear that the new owners do not have the same standards. They refused to make me a panini without tomato, the service was very slow – we had to wait 30 minutes for our food. When it did arrive (on a chipped plate) there was no apology about the wait and it looked incredibly disappointing. At half the price it still would have been overpriced for the quality and presentation. We won't be returning again. 
2	 We stumbled out of the train station into this place. The welcome from Tom (I think it was) was really friendly and helpful. There was a lunchtime deal which made the food really really reasonable. I can't remember the exact price as a few weeks ago now but it was really very cheap. The food was basic pub food but done well, served promptly and good value. They deserve to do well. 
2	 My husband and I visited here with our dog on a mini honeymoon, we were on our way to Wicken Fen nature Reserve and thought it looked picturesque when driving past so decided to stop. We took our dog and sat in the rear garden, we were all made to feel welcome. We shared a starter platter and then I had the lamb burger which was delicious, good quality meat and a tasty homemade salsa type topping and my husband had jacket potato with chilli. Portions were generous and nicely presented with side salads etc. There was a water bowl for dogs but as it was so sunny we couldn't have stayed in the garden much longer as there was no shade for our dog to lay in. This is no fault of the pubs though and something that couldn't be altered, the garden was beautiful and a good size. One small touch to note, I visited the lady's toilet and there was a basket stocked with ladies toiletries for emergency use eg deodorant/hairspray etc, I thought this was such a caring touch and something I hadn't seen before! 
2	Great staff, food was good quality and well cooked. The English breakfast is superb. Coupled with a pleasant and calm atmosphere Well recommended
2	 We have been to this restaurant 5 times in the last 12 months. Each time the bill gets to £140 ish, but we are very fortunate to have Tesco vouchers Boost that means we only pau for our drinks (about £40, so a real bargain).  Love their Pecorino wine, fabulous. I also love their Lobster with mustard sauce (shame it is only 1/2 a lobster. The staff is AMAZING there, really make you feel relax and comfy. The Maitre d'hotel (I believe French, slim, dark hair and glasses) is the only person who seems a bit uncomfortable with the rest of the team, maybe because they mainly are Italians I believe), but he seems nice too, just not as chatty and smooth.  We always ask for the same table, and we have never had any issue getting it, even though they just know we came 4 out of 5 times with Tesco vouchers (they know when I book, just with my name, that I like a specific table). I like this little touch.  We are going to return in January, can't wait. 
2	We arrived on a Wednesday evening at 8pm and were told there was a 2 hour wait to be seated inside or we could be seated straight away outside. With a 12 year old in tow a long wait wasn't an option and to be honest it was a lovely evening so we weren't bothered. We went inside after eating for a couple of drinks and took in the atmosphere and looked around at all the instruments, clothing etc. The staff were very friendly and nothing was too much bother. Food expensive for what you get, but it is the Hard Rock Café and you pay for the experience - but saying that the burger was lush.
2	Nice location and very friendly staff. The food was good but not brilliant. Very busy but prompt attention. A good selection of cocktails.
2	 Had Sunday lunch, very tasty, lamb shank tender, chicken very tasty(menu did stated chicken to share for 4 people -only enough for two people). Good atmosphere, children there but didn't notice them as place is so big. Service very good, we had a very friendly waiter. If you want to go somewhere different definitely the place to go 
2	 Great day live music superb food all ages mobbed and the staff smiled all day long.the Castle has two beer festivals ayear 
2	 My partner and I are from Leicestershire and we decided on a wet and grey bank holiday Monday to take a trip into Warwick, check out the local shops and perhaps have a light lunch somewhere. We stumbled across Catalan on Jury Street, a brightly adorned red and yellow tapas restaurant. We popped our heads in for a snoop (to ask for a menu to take away of course) and were immediately welcomed by the beautiful smell of Spanish food, warm atmosphere and very friendly gentleman on the front of house. Our mind was made up. So we went and browsed the shops and came back some two hours later. It was a lovely touch that he remembered us on our return, we were seated (even the restaurant was small and not packed) on a table for two away from other diners, which was considerate, and immediately presented with water for the table and warm bread and oils. Beautiful touch! I ate mainly a vegetarian diet and was excited and pleased to see so much choice on the menu. My partner and I order, grilled asparagus, wilted spinach with pine nuts and garlic, peppers in tobasco, meatballs, mixed salad with goats cheese, potatas bravas and catalana bread. We were not disappointed. The food came all at once, hot, beautiful colours and very fresh. The restaurant also offered a good selection of soft drinks, hot drinks and native beers and wines.  The waitress took the time to come over and check that everything was OK with the meal and a little later the owner himself visited each table in turn and stopped to ask if all was OK. Fantastic service. My only critical points would be to tidy up the back area and keep an eye on the dripping air conditioning system. But nothing that impinged on a very enjoyable, lazy and lengthy late lunch. Overall a memorable experience and I am sure we will return. 
2	Went at lunchtime on a very rainy Monday,waiting for my daughters duke of Edinburgh ceremony. Couldn't ask for better. Good atmosphere, good service and tasty food.
2	 This is a nice friendly place to eat, good choice of menu, and the staff are really good in making sure you get what you want 
2	 Really enjoyed a quick lunch here linguine bolognaise and glass of excellent red wine for under a tenner. Highly recommended. 
2	 8 of us ate here and we were all happy with our meal. Staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly. Two of us had the Lasagna Verde as we are vegetarians and it was really tasty. Everyone else had a selection of pizzas or risotto. All were pleased except the risotto serving was very small. Otherwise good value. 
2	 Really good food, great atmosphere and lovely staff! Will be going back! A lovely pub for friends and family :) 
2	 Good service and very helpful clean and value for money good choice on menu, lots of different teas to choose from well worth a visit 
2	 Lovely food. Great kids menu. Relaxed atmosphere. Good pint of Speckled Hen. Definitely recommend. Tables get cleared out at 9pm (Easter Saturday) - to make way for live music. Not sure if that's every Saturday, but best check if you want longer dining. 
2	 We used a Groupon voucher for our meal, so although it was discounted, we had an excellent meal, good & attentive service & had'nt realised the pub was there, as tucked away down a lane. Just by the canalside & lovely setting, will return in the summer. Recommend this********* 
2	 I went in Goat for a dinner with my friend and I really enjoy. The food was really good (San Daniel pizza and the cheesecake was amazing), just in busy time, you need to wait a bit longer for the food to arrive but it didn't bother me. The atmosphere is good and really great service, really friendly and attentive. I recommend this restaurant and will, for sure, go back there!!! 
2	 Superb well cooked full English breakfast served with toast and fresh coffee. The service friendly quick and efficient. Great value for money. 
2	Visited on burger night and my boyfriend said the burger was lovely. I don't like burgers but the chef happily cooked a chicken burger for me which was really nice! Would have liked to visit on another night but it was closed for refurbishments.
2	We went one lunchtime courtesy of a groupon deal. There was a good choice & range of plates, each colour coded so it's easy to see what you're paying. The food was very fresh & the sushi some of the best I've tasted. The staff were friendly & helpful, though not at all attentive & we had to struggle to get their attention. I don't particularly like staff who are constantly in your face, checking on you between mouthfuls, but a little attention would have been appreciated. That said it didn't reflect on the quality of food served & will definitely be coming back.
2	 Let me start by saying the staff here are great and went out of their way to make our lunch fun. We were a tad disorganised and hadn't highlighted it was a birthday meal and we appeared in drubs and drabs i.e some were earlier than others but they managed to sort a window seat and also brought a lovely birthday plate with a little sweet treat for my friend with a candle !!! Sooooo kind. So the food is pricey but lovely and the view is great, the cocktails were also yum..... It is open plan so noise does travel if you want a quiet subdued venue it's not for you, but I loved it. I will def be back again next time at night when all of the London lights are on show. 
2	 Very nice food cooked well. Offers mostly traditional meals. Staff are really friendly. Possibly best too book. Can't be quite costly like on a Friday/Saturday night but the food is worth it. Set in a really nice location. 
2	Nice interior, prompt service, nice food (though the Chimichanga was a bit greasy), but as a party of 4, all of the other food was excellent, though portions were a bit large for us! We'll be back.
2	 Generally very good experience. Decor is good, staff friendly and food well-presented and tasty. Made an online booking a couple of weeks in advance, which was confirmed on the day by phone. Good variety in the food, Not too expensive either, at &lt;£40 per person for good quality food. 
2	 Reasonably priced food for a local pub - just wish the décor and surroundings could be updated - lets the place down. It needs brightening up and the carpet taken up and a slate floor put down. The wood could be painted a trendy shade of blue, grey or anything to lighten this pub up as the ceiling with the beams is very low and the lighting abysmal. The brewery needs to bring this pub up to date. It is like sitting in someone's front room who is firmly stuck in the 70's. 
2	 Loved this bar the theme and entertainment looks great. Unfortunately was fully booked whilst we was there so pre-book before attending and hoping to get in on the night for the dinner show. We ate our breakfasts here on both mornings of our stay, The food tasted great but service was a little slow.  The coffees were luke warm when arriving at the table as they were left on the side a while after being made. When ordering our breakfasts a couple of people asked to remove a couple of items and replaced with something else. For example no black pudding, mushrooms or tomatoes and only got one slice of bacon in exchange? - whilst paying full price. I ordered poached eggs on toast and was charged for eggs Benedict after they forgot about my drink and food? I would of just assumed a discounted price would of been the right think to do if I was serving a customer who had to wait for their drink and food whilst everyone else was tucking in.  Other than that is was great and it was a shame we missed teh show :(! 
2	 Situated next to the premier inn by the side of the canal. Lots of tables (and heaters) if you want to sit outside. Plenty choice on the menu. Have visited this pub lots of times and have yet to have a bad meal. The lunch time menu available until 5pm is certaintly worth a look. 2 courses for a set price is very good value. Ideal if you have children who dont want a kids menu! as i have. The garlic flatbread is also a favourite with my grandaughter. 
2	 Food was lovely, service let things down rare lamb when ordered for well done and no food was hot when it arrived. We were a later table but feel things should still be good, and then to top off our lunch a photo shoot through our lunch was quite frankly totally unnecessary as they close for the evening on Wednesdays for dinner??  The meal was however great and we will return to give them a second go at getting it right. 
2	 Went with a group of friends on a Sunday to have a classic english Sunday roast. It was really good. With perfect Yorkshire Pudding. Great place to catch up with people for a pint or some good traditional food. 
2	 We had come in the evening before for some baklava to soothe our nerves after a terrible meal at another restaurant. Bog standard though the baklava was it was, we noticed the open charcoal grill and vowed to return for some fresh food after the awful reheated chicken experience of that day.  We did, for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered falafal, and chicken and lamb kebabs. The service, while very friendly, was a little slow- the waitress struggled to get our orders due to work men obstructing her way- but everything came within a reasonable time. There were drilling and works happening out back, which were inappropriate and loud, though thankfully, brief. While our waitress didn't come and apologise for it of her own volition, she was sweet in her assurances that it would soon be over, when we asked. Based on the bad reviews on this website, I assume they are in the midst of a refit- the toilet cistern even h 
2	 ...which is probably just as well! Just a few steps away from Smithfield Market, one of the largest wholesale meat markets in Europe, this restaurant - with its white-tiled walls - looks like it could be a butcher's shop with a kitchen in the back and some hastily arranged tables in the front. The menu is frequently refreshed and is no-nonsense, using language that is simple and descriptive as well as a few words that require some translation from the knowledgeable and helpful staff. The tables and chairs are very simple and offer very little comfort. This is clearly a place for eating but probably not dining, so if you're looking for somewhere to pop the question to your sweetheart; this is not it. The portions are moderate but the tastes are remarkable and can be washed down with an impressive array of drinks that are as creatively concocted as the food. Although meat is firmly on the menu, vegans need not be dissuaded from getting involved because the freshly prepared dishes can be tailored to suit everyone who goes through the door. 
2	We eat at this popular cafe probably once a week or so and have always been happy with the food and service. The quantities are good and my particular favourite is the liver and bacon. The staff are pleasant and helpful. Great value for money too.
2	 We really enjoyed our meal in this tiny little restaurant above the take-away. You can bring your own booze which meant that our meal seemed very good value for money. The service was good - highly recommended. 
2	Discovered this restaurant by accident on the way back to our hotel last Saturday, we liked the sound of the menu so we asked if we could book a table for that night. The owner said that they were very busy but if we didn't mind waiting until around 8:30pm he would arrange a table for us - I am so pleased that we did. The atmosphere is lovely and friendly and the staff are all very helpful and didn't mind answering questions about the dishes on the menu to aid our selection. There were four of us and we all enjoyed our meals immensely; the food is freshly cooked and very tasty, thick chunky homemade chips are delicious. Lovely desserts, which I had to try even though I was quite full after my patê starter and Chicken cordon bleu main course - so Lemon Lush was ordered and it was lush, my husband was also in dessert heaven with a proper homemade jam suet roll and custard. It was also great value for money. Can't wait to go again next time we are staying in Darlington.
2	 Visited Thai Balcony a week ago with my boyfriend. We were amazed by the prawn soup we had for starter, totally recommend it. We then had roasted duck and spicy chicken for main served with rice. Satisfying quantity of food. The Thai beer that we have tried was really tasty and refreshing as well. The atmosphere was beautiful with designs which make you feel you are in Asia. 
2	 Sapori's is AMAZING!!! Not far from Westminster and the prices are excellent. Good portions ...excellent MUG of tea ..... we had the breakfast ..... which was all hunky dory ...BUT BUT ... their toast is zoooomy muchly hunky dory !!!... very hunky and chunky indeed ... it is the BEST TOAST IN THE WORLD!!! (as far as I'm concerned anyway!!!) It's not a big place by any means, but the staff are really friendly, nothing too much trouble. Polite and respectful. I tell all our friends to go there when they are in that area. But don't forget to take your cash .... it's the only way you can pay! 
2	 Stopped here before going to the cinema. The staff in this restaurant chain never fail to give good service. Love the food and the selection of sauces 
2	 We were in the area visiting my in-laws who have recently moved to Chilcompton and with it being my birthday the previous day, they suggested we went to The Somerset Wagon for a meal. The food was very good and we all enjoyed it very much. The pub was very busy but the waiting staff coped very well and I would thoroughly recommend going here but be sure to book a table. We all had 3 courses and it worked out about £24 a head without drinks. 
2	Nice Lounge, friendly, polite staff and food of good standard and didn't wait too long considering it was busy ( teamtime on a friday noght )
2	 Stumbled across this little gem by accident. The Food was delicious with Lots of choice. Good service. 
2	 The food was great. Waiter was fantastic too and very helpful as we had a surprise birthday cake for our birthday person.   
2	 called here last friday for our dinner, as we had heard that it was nice, when we arrived their we was greeted at the door ,and shown to a table. the place was very clean , tables set to a very good standed. excelent custmer service was not rushed in ordering our meal , and very good valule for money the food is excelent , the place was packed so it must speak for it self all staff were very friendly and helpfull would go back, again and again in fact next time i go to whitby for the day , i will just go to there restaurant their as i know there is one in whitby 
2	 Went for an early roast lunch. Fab cheese soufflé followed by carvery. More expensive than some but worth it and the service was great. Will come again. 
2	 Great stout and friendly welcome. Food arrived quickly which was good as 6 people eating. Good traditional atmosphere. 
2	 I go here with my partner almost every week. The price is amazing and the food is lovely. This seems to be the only place we eat because we know we like the food. Would recommend it to anyone, and I'd recommend the Ribs and Chicken. Ribs are delicious. But everything I've ate in there is lovely. 
2	 Ate here having booked a table and having read some bad reviews I was seriously worried. But I needn't have been, it a busy Saturday in half term, and our experience was great. Granted the food is not haute cuisine but it was delicious, I had the pulled pork sandwich which was spicy just as I like it. Although the prices seem steep I think some people are missing the point which is that you pay more for the experience! My little one had just decided to give up chocolate for Lent and they adapted his pudding choice accordingly so he could have his fave banana split. It can be noisy but I liked that .... It was terrifying for my 4 year old but we joked about it and made it part of the fun telling those gorillas to stop shaking their tree and get back in their cage. I would love to go again it was a highlight of our mini break! I knocked off a star because as other reviewers mentioned they do add a service charge to an already high priced menu although we always tip if we enjoy the food and service and more importantly they clear the plates before the group has finished ... Tut tut! 
2	 Me and my partner visited Beamers on a Sunday evening.  The waitresses were very nice and helpful. The food was excellent and there was a good variety.  Would visit again and recommend to visitors of Brixham. 
2	 People really do love to moan don't they....I was a bit worried about booking this restaurant after reading reviews on here but we were very happy with our meal on Sunday, food was lovely, freshly cooked and tasted great, the beef was the best we'd all had in a long time, desserts was amazing! They had a nice children's menu and my 4 year old boys enjoyed their food too. We were late for our booking but the staff were very helpful and friendly and let us eat our desserts outside as they had another booking for our table. Yes it is a bit oldy woldy and it could do with a bit of a spruce up but overall we had a really nice afternoon here, don't be put off by the over critical people on here. 
2	 We have been to this restaurant several times for Sunday lunch and on a couple of other occasions. The service is very good and the staff are friendly and helpful. The last time we were there, was last Sunday. And once again we thoroughly enjoyed our Sunday lunch. We were unable to eat our deserts but they were boxed up so we could take them home. I recommend giving this place a try if you have not been. 
2	 We booked at the last minute and were glad we did. It was quiet when we went in at 7pm but the place filled up very fast after that.  We ordered the Sukhothai set menu for two, which we don't normally do but it sounded really yummy.  We waited 20-25 minutes for our mixed starter to arrive, which is a little on the slow side but they were obviously busy with both the restaurant and takeaways. It was very tasty, apart from the spring rolls which didn't have much filling and were a bit dry. The Thai fish cakes were fabulous! We then waited another 20-25 minutes for our main course, but luckily we weren't in a hurry. And it was very well worth waiting for. The duck curry and the lemongrass chicken were both absolutely delicious as were the veggies. There was loads of it too - very good value for money.  Small word of caution, all the main dishes were on the spicy side, so you need to mention when you order if you want them to rein that in a bit.  We would definitely recommend it. 
2	 I used to work here when it first opened and it hasn't lost its charm, very cosy. food could be better 
2	 Four of us had a very good meal here and were impressed with the service and quality food. The portions were large, tasty and well presented. The restaurant was busy and atmosphere warm and friendly. 
2	It is worth the inevitable queue to have brunch here. Our group of seven ordered a wide variety of dishes from the menu and all of the food was delicious, the service was quick and the food was cooked exactly as we requested - important if, like me, you always want to substitute or tweak the items as described on the menu! The décor and atmosphere add to the experience but the biggest draw is the food! Join the queue - you won't regret it!
2	 I had heard amazing things about Paradise from friends who regularly eat or drink there, so I was excited when I finally had the chance to dine there last week with friends.   The service was fab and the food was even better! My steak was cooked to perfection and the atmosphere was great.  The best part was my expresso martini for pudding. Divine. 
2	 Unless you are an oligarch you wouldn't consider eating or drinking here every day. First of all the place is fairly cramped, with seating on benches, or at a shelf at the window, outside on benches or at one of 3 small (wobbly) tables deep inside behind the kitchen (where it is a bit quieter, to be fair). So it doesn't say 'come in and relax for hours'. It's also mind-bendingly expensive.  Having said all that, the baked goods on offer are absolutely divine: delicious, generous, tasty, freshly baked and the toughest thing having decided to indulge is deciding what to choose. Fabulous range of muffins (my favourite is the bran); cheese sticks, croissants; unusual buns of diverse sorts; sandwiches are a cut above the norm; 'everyday' items like brownies and flapjack styles are very pricey, like everything else.  The coffee is excellent.  They do a menu of light snack food but haven't had it yet. They also sell a fabulous range of breads. If you are a yeast lover, go and try but be aware, it will cost. Maybe a place to meet a friend for an hour's treat time. 
2	 I walked past this a few times and always saw how busy it was so I braves it with a friend. Service was excellent and food was more than delicious. We tried the meze prawns, vine leaves, potatoes and had a rice dish with 3 meats to share. More than filling for 2 hungry beavers! Definitely coming back 
2	 Found this little gem in Bournemouth. Seem to be popular with locals and tourists. Nice tasty, fresh sushi. But a word of warning, service can be slow but then each sushi is hand rolled! 
2	I visited with my friend for afternoon tea on Monday , we were worried after reading the previous reviews but when we arrived we were greeted by a lovely waitress who sat us, we couldn't get over how beautiful the building was. When are afternoon tea arrived we where told to our surprise that everything was home made even the bread it was delicious! We LOVED it an we will definitely be returning. Hats off to the chef or the lovely food and thank you to the waitress for making are afternoon so enjoyable. Don't knock this place till you have tried it yourselves if we had gone by the previous reviews we wouldn't of gone but we are so glad we did! See you soon merchants
2	 A different style of pizza for those who fancy a change. You pay by the yard. Not cheap, but not too expensive. It's one of those novelty places you try a few times, but can get bored with. That's not to say you should not give it a go as some of the pizzas are amazing. 
2	 Al Dar is a really authentic Lebanese restaurant with a range of delicious food. great for a quick lunch or supper. It's not fancy or slick, just delicious and good value for money. 
2	I really like the wide choices and willingness to substitute other things for dietary reasons - even though this may go a tiny bit wrong on occasion. However it is always put right with a smile so I have no complaints.   The food is also very good and tasty and the restaurant seems to be well managed.   The lunch offers available are varied and excellent value for money.
2	 I was struggling to find somewhere to take the kids to eat that wasn't a fish and chip/burger place. We were delighted when we found The Taj Mahal. All the staff were great; very welcoming and friendly. The food was good although I did find the sauces a little too sweet - not a problem for the kids though! 
2	 I remember The Elephant's Nest from when I was a teenager and used to drop in for a quick cider after a Sunday morning's horseriding nearby! The pub is now much more: lovely atmosphere with a few rooms to eat in (or outside in a lovely garden if the weather is good!). You need to book these days because it is popular and busy.  Food is very good: from a regular roast to a varied menu, with good veggie options. Puddings to die for! And the old dog (can't think of his name now!) lolloping around makes you feel right at home. Well behaved dogs are welcome, by the way! 
2	We visited here at lunch time on a Tuesday it was very busy but the chefs worked fast to keep the carverey queue down, As with all carvereys You queue at the bar for a drink then queue again for your food, but once you have it, its lovely , not a huge choice of veg , but it was nice , certainly go again
2	 Always tasty, good lunch time service...had a few of the veggie options and never been disappointed. Last visit I asked for a combination of 2 of the pasta dishes to make it veggie and they happily obliged; delicious it was too. Normally visit with work friends at lunch. 
2	 We went on a wednesday when they have a 2 4 1 offer on mains. Pizzas are very large and you can tell the quality of the ingredients used. However my olives to start were not pitted as I would of expected and they served my wine in a normal glass. Minor down points to an otherwise great evening. 
2	 The previous reviews mentioning price almost put us off from going....however, having enjoyed a delicious, authentic thai meal, my boyfriend and I came to the same conclusion; you get what you pay for!  We shared the vegetarian hot platter to start and followed this by the Tiger Prawn curry (v.spicy) with sticky rice and a delicious pork and vegetable noodle dish. The portions were ample and we did not have any room to try the array of desserts on offer.  The service was very good at the atmosphere in the restaurant was v.pleasant.  I would certainly recommend Thai Edge Leeds to all lovers of Thai food - don't be put off by the price - if you're going out for a treat, it's certainly worth it! 
2	 Great pub very friendly .Thanks for letting me charge my phone ! The locals almost persuaded us to stay longer and get the bus back to Hele but so glad we walked the coastal path amazing views. 
2	 This is the place to go If you love mussels.  We choose a special offer of Leon Mussels + frites, served with 1/2 pint of Leon beer. The mussels were freshly cooked for us in a very tasty sauce. the Belgian beer was full of flavour and potent at 6% proof! All this for £8.50 per person. The service was bit haphazard but friendly,  We will be back, such good value, very fresh and tasty  Outdoor seating available a good spot for people watching. 
2	 I hadn't visited this pub for many years. There is something for all here. Outside area complimented with rugs and fire, comfortable indoor seating, superb food and friendly staff. Spent a wonderful couple of hours with my partner and parents. Recommended. 
2	 after reading some of the reviews on here I was pleasantly surprised by the service and food @the Forest Inn. the staff were friendly and welcoming out meals were nice and hot although there was a small wait for food this was not a problem. After talking with a member of staff while we waited for our food, we were told that the current manager had only taken over the post a few months earlier and was trying hard to get everything back on track. And although there might still be some work to do I will definitely be going back there 
2	Had a lovely breakfast here! If you have a large appetite this is a great place to go! For the amount of food produced the quality is good.
2	 Me and my partner came to masala bazaar last week after being recommended by one of my colleague from work. Overall the food and atmosphere was excellent apart from service. We were given a warm welcome and allocated one of the corner table by the waiter ,then he came back and brought us our drinks what we had ordered but it took a long time for him to take our food order even when both of us were ready long before. Finally the order was taken and starters arrived soon, but I was wondering where the waiter would disappear from reception suddenly , so for my curiosity I went to the reception and guess what both the waiters were sitting down behind the counter and busy with laptop but just a glance was enough for me to get my answer. To my surprise both of them were playing online bingo . Then suddenly shaking one of them asked how can I help you? I just said if you could get me another drink. What a shame guys I never expected this after being so highly recommend .14/5/14 
2	 We ate here on Saturday night and were surprised how quiet it was although lots of people came for takeaways. The meal was very tasty, I particularly liked the hot and sour soup starter and beef in black bean sauce - well it was all very good, great rice and veg. Staff friendly but non-intrusive, look forward to going back next time we're in Fowey. We are happy eating in quiet restaurants, hate crowds but I was disappointed for the restaurant they weren't busier. 
2	 The waiters were friendly, polite and efficient. The meal was very good also. I would highly recommend it to others 
2	 I love Quaglinos and have been going for some years but this was the first visit after the refurbishment. We weren't disappointed. The service is slick from being greeted and being taken to your table. One thing is, the ladies who take you to your table are in full length gowns,a nightmare when trying to negotiate the staircase down to the restaurant. Having nearly come a cropper myself a couple of times over the years, my heart was in my mouth for her on two counts, one that she was going to trip and two, that I was going to stand on the back of her dress and we were both going to go. Safely seated we had a lovely champagne cocktail from the new downstairs bar, followed by a delicious meal. The service was really good and the staff friendly. Just one other thing, there are no tablecloths. It took me a while to realise what was missing. The tables are dark wood so it does make the place look rather dark but a small thing. There is also a stage where the seafood bar used to be and I believe there was rather good entertainment on later. Sadly we had to leave and missed it but I'll be better prepared next time. Has lost none of its glamour and is highly recommended. 
2	 My daughter had told me how good the food was and she was not wrong. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The only thing that spoils it is the size of the place. It is so small we had to queue in the street and it was very cold and windy and when we actually got a table it was just by the door where people were in and out and queuing so it wasn't much warmer. A shame because I really enjoyed the food 
2	 We arrived at midday and were seated straight away. The waiter was very friendly , my children had a pizza each , smaller portion than the adult size but still quite large. My husband had the meatballs and spaghetti and I had the lasagne . We also had a portion of chips. We had 4 puddings ice team, Tiramisu, fudge cake and cheesecake which were all enjoyable and we left feeling very full! 
2	 I have been holding back for a few weeks watching what others are saying what utter nonsence some people are coming out with it doesnt take Einstein to work out this is obviously work of the ex landlady's loyal followers lets put things in perspective if you dont like the place STAY away no big loss I was a regular visitor to this pub a while ago but stopped going in because of the &quot;clique&quot; but after hearing the old landlady had left decided to go back and what a brilliant difference much better attitude all round much better service and much nicer feeling all together  As for a 16 year old serving yes it is legal maybe instead of back stabbing about a 16 yr old child check the licensing laws how low can people scoop to pick on a vulnerable girl  And as for the landlady flirting with your husbands/partners i think maybe the landlady is bisexual cos she spent a while talking to a table of ladys i might also add what a lovely person she is always a smile very hard working as are her staff (as oposed to popping outside for a cigarette leaving the bar unattended as used to happen on many occasions with the old landlady) not once did i see this landlady stopping for a break all the time i was in the establishment  Food was worth every penny with huge helpings and very tasty served with a smile from very friendly staff  Maybe the old clique would of preferred the owners to close down this pub for a few months until they can find someone who fits in with there clique 
2	 I visited Deja Vu for a second time tonight and it was just as lovely as the first. I travel a lot for work and often dine out alone which for a female can be uncomfortable at times. Thankfully here, the environment and the staff make you feel really welcome. Plus the food tastes great and it's good value too - 3 courses for £17.95 if you have space for dessert . 
2	 I was told when booking as it was Mothers day that we had to be out within two hours. As it turned out there was no pressure to leave as it was down to as and when we were served. The food was yummy, I had the spare ribs to start followed by the duck salad. The roast dinners looked amazing and tasted as good as my son had it and left nothing. The atmosphere was pleasant but we were in the conservatory alone ,but once it filled up it was quite noisy. All six of us enjoyed the food best of all, and like the level of noise least of all. But this is one of our favourite resturants and we will be back in the not too distant future. 
2	 You cannot fault the attentive and delightful staff. Set menus can be a bit worrisome, will there be enough choice? Is it &quot;a not so good version&quot; of the a la carte menu? However, no need to worry as there was a great choice and the food was delicious. My only comment is that my braised lamb really could have done with something green on the plate - it was a tad heavy on the meat fest. 
2	 Went with a group of friends so food took quite a while to come out. When it did it was lovely, really tasty. The music was too loud so you couldn't really have a conversation just shout to one another so that wasn't great and the table we were given bended round so was quite strange. I'd go back but quite expensive so not that often 
2	 A friend and I stopped by for some unexpected lunch today.  The place is really warm, snug, lovely decor, open fire, comfy surroundings...relaxing music. Perfect!  There was two sides to choose to dine, the bar side which is slightly more informal (order yourself at till) or the restaurant (more formal table service). As we had just been for a jog, we stayed in the bar side...  The food was really exceptional and portions were very good indeed. Great menu choices and presentation - prices were also very reasonable...could not fault any of it!!!  My only niggles with this place is the attention to detail with the ladies, really not great, clean or up to scratch with the other invested parts of the pub, which is a let down.  Staff were friendly enough...but attention to detail giving customers crockery that were dirty, salt and pepper nearly empty...empty glasses on tables, Valentine's Day sign outside when it's over....(and it was empty in the pub!) perhaps me being too picky as I work with hospitality - but these little details make a huge difference...i know it's a popular place and has a good reputation...little changes to detail could make this an outstanding country pub. 
2	We phoned the Bell Inn at 7:40pm to ask if they would have a table for 6 in the next twenty minutes... on a Saturday night we didn't think we would have much luck... I spoke to Collin and he couldn't have been more friendly or helpful and said that he could have a table available for just after 8pm which suited us perfectly! We arrived early and our table was ready!  The menu was full of choice! All our meals were very well presented, full of flavour and very filling!! The salads were very colourful and filled with lots of different things to try!   Four of us made some room for dessert and I am very glad I did! I love Crème brûlée and try it whenever it's on the menu and it was one of the best Crème brûlées I have tasted!   I would highly recommend this pub! Lovely atmosphere, great staff and yummy food!!   Next time we are in Stratford we will  definitely be going back!!  
2	 Lovely restaurant with very nice food. A good selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. There was little explanation of what the vegetarian dishes contained, so I was not expecting my chosen dish to be a stew, but it was very tasty and a very large portion. My only criticism is that the music/ambience was too loud, so we struggled to hear each other speak and had even more trouble hearing the waiting staff. 
2	 Went to the Greystoke to catch up with friends (as it is really convenient for the tube for all of us). We had a really nice evening, with good service from barman Daniel, and very nice food. We will definitely be visiting again. 
2	 We came here with a group of friends for a birthday and the polo the following day. We managed to up our booking from 6-8 with some persuasion (no justisn't an answer for us!)   So on arrival, parking was perfect as we parked right next to the restaurant and it only cost £1 for the whole evening (coming from London, that's a breeze!)  On entering we were so well looked after, bread straight on the table and it was endless as we were chatting so much, staff were very helpful with all of our questions on and off the menu.  Now I used to be a food taster for a large concierge company so I am very fussy. I had ham and melon then the steak, cooked to how I like (it was fatty in parts, but maybe that's just the type of steak), everyone else went for the fish dishes, I did not hear one complaint from anyone, and we are all a tough crowd to please. We had the house rose which was very reasonable and very drinkable too.  This restaurant isn't the cheapest, but that's not why you're coming here, you come here for a fabulous view, great service and good food.   I would say it was worth a visit for a bite to eat, I would pre look up the menu if you can or example menus from this restaurant though, so you know what to expect and the approximate price you will be paying. 
2	 Good choice of vine. Tasty and nicely served food. Very tasty dessert. Helpful, competent and friendly staff member Ola. We waited shortly despite the fact there was a lot people and restaurant looked busy.  
2	Went for lunch with three friends today. The restaurant was decorated very pleasantly. There was a good choice of food, but not to much to baffle you. The service was good and food delisious. My friends and i i will certainly return to sample the other choices on the menu.
2	 Had my birthday dinner there was eight of us and we all had an absolutely lovely meal and couldn't fault it at all.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner one of Oxford's good restaurants. 
2	 Good food, lovely surroundings and value for money. Quick service and friendly staff. 2 for 1 meal deal during the week is worth taking advantage of. 
2	 imaginative food, well cooked and reasonably priced. service excellent. a little noisy but that seems to be the norm as nearly everywhere has solid floors 
2	 Only popped in for a glass of wine, but made to feel so welcome by the staff, especially Abi. Wonderful looking food on offer, will definitely go for a meal next time. 
2	 Tasty food, friendly bar staff and and good service. Puddings were delicious and worth a visit just for them alone. 
2	i like trip advisor. i find it a useful tool for when i want to go away and i always try to look at other reviews with a sensible eye. everyone has different ideas and different views. it struck me that i have not actually reviewed the places in my local area and I i sat down to do just that and was shocked at the two last reviews on the Amberwood. i was present when those families were there and quite frankly am surprised at the reviews they posted.we actually left our local pub rather than stay there while they were present,  the amberwood is a friendly local pub that welcomes families with children, the food is traditional pub food and good. the staff are friendly and the reception received has always been informal and welcoming. i have been there with children being boisterous and happy and there is a fine line between happy families and families running riot. is it the best pub in the area possibly not. price wise others in the area are keener but will i return absolutely yes... worth a vist if you are in the area.. yes definitely
2	 For the first time ever my parents, sister and myself decided to have Christmas lunch 'out!' We chose this pub which is close to where we live and it didn't disappoint.The four course meal was beautifully cooked and served by the staff who were very friendly and particularly considerate to my mum who is in a wheelchair. Thank you for a lovely day ! 
2	 Visited Baffito's on a Friday evening, the food was delicious and the portions for both the starters and mains are massive.  I have been a couple of times now and never had a bad meal. The service was OK but as we were served by about 5 different people, it got confusing whether I needed to repeat my order to the next waiter than came over. Overall, really nice decor, nice food and good beer selection. Its worth a visit. 
2	 As a local, this is our place of choice when we eat out.  Food has been good, only had 1 or 2 bad meals.  Chefs Chicken is amazing - The tomato sauce is to die for.  Would recommend. 
2	 A welcoming, friendly bistro with an extensive menu which includes reasonably priced, value for money dressed crab. For those of us who do not share the love of fish there is a varied selection of alternative dishes all equally reasonably priced. All the food is freshly prepared, well presented, with the well-sized portions being hot and tasty. Along with a wide range of pastries, cakes and snacks, together with a selection of hot or cold drinks, there's something to suit everyone's tastes.  While it's slightly off the main area of the town, don't ignore this excellent bistro. Seek it out and enjoy their home-made food. 
2	 good fish and chips - waiting staff are always excellent.  Can really recommend the Whitebait.   Downside - the room is always cold. 
2	 Just right for Pre-Theatre drinks or meal Tasty main courses & lovely desserts.  Very nice ambience  Good service 
2	 This place is so much better since the refurbishment, but I still feel it lacks atmosphere, I think it's something to do with the layout. The food has definitely improved, I had the burger with bacon and cheese and it was delightful. A huge meaty burger, little fat, crunchy salad and crisp fries. The steak comes highly recommended by my boyfriend, although not to my taste and the fish and chips were also great, quality fish with light crispy batter. This pub/restaurant/hotel will always be busy because of the fabulous location, but it could be sooooo much better. 
2	 We have dined there a couple of times now. The first time was at lunch time and we were pleased with the food choice and it was cooked to perfection. We did not order any alcohol at that visit due to the time of day. I choose the chicken & chirozo skewers and was not disappointed. It is good value for money as you can help yourself to as much salad as you want. The second time we visited was in the evening. It was very busy and the staff warned us there was a half hour wait but as we could help ourselves to the salad while we waited and the time passed quickly anyway. The staff are lovely and nothing is too much trouble. The decor is nothing to write home about, its pretty basic actually but I wouldn't let that put you off. The only thing that we didn't like was the price of the alcohol. My husband had a bottle of coors light and we were charged a whopping £3.75 for a normal size bottle. Bit of a rip off really. So my advice is just be careful what drinks you order. Cokes and such are refillable so this is clearly were they re-coop their money, but all in all a good meal. 
2	 We arrived quite late at night and they accommodated us although there were some items from the menu not available. The waitress on Sunday evening was fantastic. We had a breaded chicken which was ok but a little dry for my taste however the spaghetti on the side was absolutely superb. My boyfriend had a steak and ordered it medium rare but it came medium well we thought so just something to keep in mind. 
2	 had a meal out with family. hadn't been out together for a while. The food was ok with plenty of choice. No waitress to take our order so had to order at the bar. ok but as there was a few of us it could have been handled better. Will go back again but maybe book next time. 
2	 Lovely food! Wasn't much on the menu choice wise for different flavours of pizza and cocktails were very expensive. But we took our two dogs and sat outside a couple of other dogs on the courtyard very dog friendly. 
2	 Fabulous food and we couldn't have been made more welcome. High quality wine too. And a free belly dancing display. A great night. 
2	 A very good menu for families with a excellent choice at reasonable prices. Family entertainment most evenings & a lovely outdoor seating area 
2	 We visited this restaurant in August at 8.00pm. We all had a three course meal, with drinks, which came to a very reasonable £45 per couple. The meal started with homemade bread rolls and butter, which were very yummy.The rest of the meal was absolutely gorgeous, with the group sampling from both the pasta and pizza options. The portions were absolutely massive and we could not finish the dishes. We would definitely recommend Julio's others. 
2	 I have been following the various reviews on Ametsa, which are mixed... and certainly make you wonder. But a good friend went and she loved it. And we did too. Service was impecable. Food was fresh, light, full of flavours. All dishes seemed to have a 'touch' of molecular something but that was just a touch which paired well with the main 'ingredient'. Loved the fish (the prawn, the seabass) and the broth. We chose wines based on the recommendations and they were amazing. If I will fault something is the decor... which is neither warm nor inviting. I guess the food is meant to be the main protagonist but I will consider revisiting some of it to make the room cozier. So, do not pay attention to the critics and go with friends (or family). 
2	 This pub should be reported for masquerading under false pretenses. The food here is not pub grub; it is worthy of a high class restaurant in any major city! Non locals have to look hard to find this hidden gem, a pretty ancient inn nestling on a trout river bank in deeply rural Hampshire (n the Pilgrim Way, I believe) but the rewards are great. It's a green wellies, tweeds and pearls pub with blazing log fires when needed - yesterday they were needed. I live some 20-odd miles away so in recent years I have only ever lunched there (on three occasions) and each time I have been highly impressed with the ambience and - especially - the menu and quality of the food and wines. My personal favourite there is a Stornaway Black Pudding with a perfectly poached egg as a starter, and yesterday I had a whole Dover sole as a main course, beautifuly cooked and served with nicely al dente vegetables. With a large glass of good dry wine it cost about £25 - a small enough price to pay for true excellence, I thought. The pudding menu looked great, but sadly I could not manage another morsel by then. Each time I have been there it has been crowded and I have always booked in advance to get my favourite table in a quiet corner by a window (The Bat table - there is a stuffed bat hanging near it). From reading other reviews of this pub it seems that lunchtime is probably a better time to go to get the real value from it; goodness knows how a stranger would find it after dark, anyway! I had originally booked for a Wednesday but I was phoned and advised that they were going to lose their electricty that day and would only be able to offer cold meals, so I changed the day to Tuesday. I thought this a thoughtful act. The ambience was good, happy buzz of chatter - thank goodness no musak. Service between courses a bit slow but well worth the wait and I was with good friends who had lots to say! Highly recommended. 
2	 Found La Lupa by accident on the internet while looking for somewhere else and it was definately a very lucky find. The food was very good and plenty of it, the drinks were priced the same as any other restaurant me and my partner have eaten in and the service was very good all in all a very good night out and a miracle find as there seem to be very few Italian restaurants around that arn't part of a big chain any more. 
2	loved the views and great food. Bar area smelled fusty, but conservatory room lit with candles had lovely atmosphere.
2	a really nice setting and the lunch was good, its a great setting the service could be improved as slow when busy
2	 Very good breakfast. Great tea. Staff friendly and welcoming but a really a long wait for meal to be served.. Wouldn't put me off going again as food was great. 
2	 We had our two Labradors with us, so sat in the bar area'. Leamne served us and the dogd, ensuring they had a big bowl pf water and treats. We ordered the chicken tandorri bloomer and it was a lovely taste, arriving quite quickly with a smile and friendly service. We (and the dogs) would recommend this as a brilliant place to eat and to take dogs 
2	Having come back from Bath late , we had not eaten and it was a Sunday night. Phoned the pub up as I noted it was a minute away by car and they said as long as we arrived by 20.30 and put the order in, they could accommodate us.It was now 20.20 Just got there in time, quickly browsed the menu and ordered. Service was quick. Both had the Roast beef and vegetables and have to say mine was absolutely delicious, the gravy was the best I have tasted in a while and the meat was cooked just right for me. My partner prefers his meat well done so could not eat his, but would just like to point out that was not the chiefs fault. They had accommodated us at the last minute and I am sure , if we had asked, they would have cooked it a bit longer. 
2	 We really enjoyed the vegan nachos, super salad and carrot cake at this fun and quirky cafe. The service was slow, but I think it was a bad day - the staff were very apologetic 
2	 A small narrow restaurant, with friendly staff and amazing food. Each meal I've had at Syrinana's has been very different. Great place to visit to experience new flavours. 
2	A group of 6 adults and 2 children enjoyed a very nice meal. Staff were very friendly and helpful with the children's menu choices and there was a good choice of non traditional Sunday lunch dishes on the menu. I had an excellent vegetarian starter starter and main course that I'd never had before 10 out of 10, and we all enjoyed the modern stylish and relaxed dining area. For me as the only veggie out of the group If The Crown keeps being innovative with the choice and flavours then I'll certainly return.
2	 Party of 11 had evening meal. All meals were lovely, staff very friendly and helpful. Steak pie was absolutely gorgeous. Would definitely recommend. Good idea to book for evening meals. 
2	 My husband and I have passed Middletons many times and noticed it was very popular, so we had a chance to try it out on Saturday lunch time. So glad we did. We had the lunch time deal 9.95 for two courses, 10.95 for three. I had garlic mushrooms which came in a big bowl in a tasty sauce and small slices of bread. My husband had crayfish cocktail and it was huge and yummy. We both felt quite full and wondered if we could fit in main course. Mine was the burger, which was simple along with fries, hubby has steak which looked a bit small but was very tasty, along with fries. I didn't like the food coming on wooden boards but the waitress said we could have plates if requested at time of order. We had an Eaton Mess desert to share which was delightful. It was altogether very good value and a nice treat. 
2	 Ordered for the first time yesterday after menu came through the door recently. The food was really good and so much of it. My hubby had the Mexican Shawarma which he found spicy but nice. I had skewered chicken with some cucumber salad. We received salad, bread, our chips and rice - I thought I may have the wrong order as I unpacked at one point. The order arrived as advised. Loved it. 
2	 A real hidden gem. A birthday lunch for 13 on a Saturday we were the only party in the restraunt. The food was if a good standard although begrudged paying over the odds for a tub of Ben and Jerry's. service was very slow but we were glad to have a leisurely lunch. Staff were polite and helpful. The view, however, was amazing and really made this a special occasion. Would definitely return for afternoon tea or just a coffee. 
2	 I have the pleasure of eating here on a regular basis. I am immensely gratified that we now have a local pub and restaurant that has a consistently high standard of food and it's presentation, yet maintains a homely and friendly atmosphere. Whether popping in for a drink or having an evening with family and friends in the restaurant, The Stamford Arms is the quintessential English pub! 
2	 Love the service and atmosphere here. Orders from regular customers are remembered and there are places outside if you want to bring your dog 
2	 The staff were very friendly and helpful, the decor is smart and modern and the food very good indeed. 
2	Nice food, lovely staff... Defo return again as my fiancé said it was the best steak he had ever ate!!!! Thanks Cafe Rouge !!!
2	 I took my three grandsons on this trip on Sunday. We decided to try something different from a panto and we were pleasantly surprised. They had to fill in a colouring page which was judged later as we cruised. Santa got on the barge along the canal with his elf to the cheers of the children on board. He greated them all and spoke to each child individually as they sat by him. The gifts were first rate and the boys were delighted with what they got. All in all a very pleasant afternoon. We went into the garden centre and we were 'blown away' by the wonderful display of Christmas thingsl, What a beautiful place, well worth a visit, 
2	 Beautiful little vintage feel tea room, relaxed atmosphere, friendly helpful staff, food was delicious. My sister arranged for us to go for afternoon tea as a birthday treat with myself, our mum and mother in law. The cakes were amazing almost too pretty to eat (but we did and they were delicious!) and it just doesn't feel like you are where you are if you know what I mean...came out feeling nice and relaxed and full of yummy tea and cake! 
2	Tulley's has quite a large menu for a tea room. The all-day breakfast looked inviting but I wasn't quite hungry enough. I chose eggs-royale - two poached eggs and smoked salmon on bread muffins with hollandaise sauce with very decorative fresh tomatoes and cooked mushrooms and onions. I'm very fussy about poached eggs and these were perfect. The mushrooms and onions didn't add much and probably dominated the salmon taste. Prices are very reasonable - my husband had an omelette and chunky chips and the total cost was £15 including tea. Service was good and the staff helpful.
2	 I have been with friends and family in the week and for Sunday roast each meal was enjoyed by all, for the prices it was a good standard and served in good clean conditions with friendly staff. 
2	 In London for my Best mates birthday and was recommended we visit Pan Chai as we mentioned we were hardcore sushi lovers.   We were so excited and enjoying our weekend we had to come. I have never seen a sushi bar that's so glam!!   As a birthday treat we ordered the Christmas platter with the lobster. We felt like Queens dining on this amazing sushi meal. OMG its was just amazing.   This is an amazing special occasion treat if you're ever in London. Harrods is just fab but Pan Chai is like the best!! 
2	 Enjoyed the atmosphere,food was average service was bad as the place was busy and there was not enough staff on this was at a lunch time. 
2	 Couldn't resist a silly pun, but in all seriousness, this was a nice restaurant with friendly staff and decent food. We had some good cocktails too. We ordered halloumi, spanakopita, olives and mixed dips for starters - all nice. Then for mains, steak and chicken souvlaki, a little bland as I like my food packed with taste. It was great value though as we used our Taste Card so got 241 on starters and mains. A shot of Ouzo with our bill - Opa! 
2	 I have been to Manuel's three or four times now. The food is always excellent, and the staff are too. Had the best cooked squid I have ever had today plus fabulous roast lamb and a lovely tangy lemon tart. Easily one of the best restaurants in the area.... and I have sampled quite a few! 
2	 Visited the tea terrace In Dec 2016. It is great for afternoon tea, light lunch etc. The tea and wine are good. Great variety of teas to choose from. Good choice of gluten free foods also. Lovely decor and use of beautiful royal albert china., We had Christmas dinner, which was lovely and a good size portion was served. Nice and clean toilets. You need to go here at least once! 
2	 Good food and not too expensive child and dog friendly but the back room was a bit cold. 
2	 Stopped here on the off chance after wandering around Looe...small, cosy and the food was nice. Service was fine, would come back. Came with family. 
2	 Went on the off chance for Sunday lunch. It was excellent. Roast beef was very tender . Proper roast potatoes not the frozen variety. Plenty of fresh veg. Have been again since and the standard was the same. 
2	 I've been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The service is friendly, if verging on the slow at times. The food is delicious, particularly the sharing ploughmans lunch (the only problem with it was I was too full to enjoy a pudding!) 
2	 food was good, well presented and as always good service. Generous portions of meat too, unlike my visit to one in London, which was a total rip off. Always a good place for a quick meal 
2	 I do not normally like chinese restaurants. However, Pearl CIty has a variety of choices on their menu.  Service was friendly and prompt, without leaving you feeling like you were rushed out of the venue. 
2	 I have been to this restaurant on a couple of occasions, and it never disappoints...attentive service and tasty food. Oh, and don't be snobby and think you shouldn't order the chips...they're very good. 
2	 Good pub food, friendly very helpfully staff in a lovely position over looking Rye Harbour below castle. Would recommend walking down the steps from the side of the castle rather than walking along the very busy lower road and up steps 
2	Considering this is mainly meat meat meat venue they had some really good veggie options on the menu. Good food excellent value. Only criticism is that Cocktail list needs to show drinks wordy descriptions need pictures - we buy with our eyes you market your food well so maybe a new cocktail menu!?!
2	 Saturday (25th April) was our first time eating at The Grill on the Edge.  Warm and friendly welcome, beautiful, modern decor and a really pleasant and relaxing ambiance.   We ordered the warm sourdough beard to start which was really tasty. For main I had the fillet steak, mash and honey & rosemary carrots with Diane sauce - it was delicious, I could not fault it.  My partner had the 100% Wagyu burger which was slightly disappointing - a lot of liquid came from the patty which intern made the bun soggy. I would also recommend the tomato relish that is served with the burger be more flavoursome, my partner could not taste it. Perhaps more variety of sauces and topping would be good -bbq sauce, avocado, egg etc (just a suggestion). The home cut chips and mayonnaise were perfect though.  For dessert, I had the chocolate fudge cake which was nice and my partner had the sticky toffee pudding which was gorgeous.  The customer service is fantastic, very pleasant and accommodating. I will definitely be returning and will tell my friends about The Grill on the Edge!   Thanks to Harry our server who was really friendly too. 
2	 My husband and I went to this restaurant last night. I had fillet of beef and my husband had the bass. It was 1 of the best meals we have ever eaten. The baked Alaska that my husband had says it was the best ever.  We were looked after very well even though the restaurant was busy.  The restaurant is quite small and the acoustics wasn't great but we would still go back.   
2	 very clean. food was very nice and reasonably priced. quick service. nice to find somewhere to go for a cuppa and cake. 
2	 Right on the beach, it boasts a outdoor covered area outside and a small area upstairs over looking the bay. Prices are reasonable and food cooked to order. Their breakfast is great too. It is a bit if a walk from the town but a pleasant walk. Past the harbour and marina. RLNI and the breakwater itself. Plus the is a small carpark next door. 
2	Visited this place during by stay in Bath. Me and my partner booked a table 2 hours in advance during busy weekend period, but it didn't seemed necessary as it wasn't packed.  The pizzas are marvellous, tasty and original. It took little time for them to serve them and the staff was very kind and quick. We ordered deserts as well and I have to say that its tiramisú is amazing!  Must visit if you want to eat good food and leave the restaurant with a full tummy.  The only negative point was that we saw -while having dinner- the waiter carrying the rubbish to take it outside beside the tables.
2	 We often come here for lunch, and its a really nice pub. It has comfy seats and the deco is fairly modern.   We always get served quickly, and the food is always hot! The only issue i ever have with the food here is that if i have something with a fried egg, its never cooked properly - although i can fully recommend the all day breakfast!. But other than that its faultless. The staff are friendly, and the prices are amazing value!!  I'd recommend here for casual lunches/dinner/drinks.   (you also don't have to book tables which is a bonus!) 
2	 Fantastic food at great prices. A must for all curry lovers 
2	 Great dinner and amazing food. Only down-side, felt a little cramped in the restaurant with tables very close together. 
2	Came here for a family brunch and loved it! Staff were friendly, decor is great, and the atmosphere is lovely.   Cooked breakfasts were delicious - bread and bacon were both particularly good. Granola was slightly dry (hence 4/5), but tasted nice.   We'd go back, and would recommend it.
2	 You must try this place if you like Indian Food. There's a varied menu with some pleasant surprises and a good selection of traditional favourites but this is NOT your usual slop-and-go curry house. The decor, ambience, service, but most of all the exquisite quality of the food will have us coming back for more and I recommend it without hesitation. 
2	 A group of us visited Esseborne for lunch this week. We were taking advantage of an offer of three courses and a glass of wine for £17. We were not disappointed! The meal was excellent and the staff very pleasant and helpful. We are friends who play Bridge together and we wished we had brought cards with us and settled down for a game or two in the lounge!! 
2	 My boyfriend and I visited for our 5th anniversary in November. He had booked us in for lunch at the restaurant after previously taking his mum for her birthday. The meal was nice but restricting, only 6 options for mains - 4 fish, 1 steak and 1 veggie - my partner and I don't eat fish so found we weren't spoilt for option. The meal wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be so I was quite impressed with that - was £30pp. Cocktails are also nice - had a couple of those before leaving. Unfortunately my partner didn't double check the gardens were available, we couldn't go in as there was a wedding being held that day but what I saw looked good - will be going back to visit! 
2	 We went here for a family meal, all of the staff on duty were all really welcoming. The food we ordered was really good although a few extra courses were bought out by mistake and mine and my sisters order was wrong but they soon put it right. 
2	 This restaurant was recommended by a small bistro owner in Harrogate who was shut on the night I was looking for somewhere to eat. I was not disappointed with Sasso. Service was ok but friend was given wrong starter. Food was very tasty and portion size medium. was good to sit outside but there was a large dining room downstairs in the basement. Offices above but were shut when we were there. 
2	 Tried the Ribeye steak. Served rare as requested. Was tender and free of grizzle. Desserts were enjoyable. Service was a bit slow despite the fact there was only a few customers in the restaurant, which is in a bit of a dilapidated state in terms of decoration. Wallpaper is hanging off the wall in some places. Awarded 4 stars because the food was good. 
2	 Big on top quality burgers (mahooosive!) but plenty of other stuff. Can't charge to your room (if staying at the Premier), so take means of paying! 
2	 The food was excellent, service was good however I couldn't really understand the waiter! Overall it was a good experience, the wait for the food wasn't long at all and the prices are fair! 
2	My husband and I recently visited the Nom Restaurant & Bar in Hanley, Stoke on Trent. We went on a recommendation and had not visited this restaurant before. However, we were pleased to find a pleasant atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. The food was good and we enjoyed our special lunch. Definitely worth another visit.
2	 This used to be a fantastic place to eat, however has changed hands a few times over the few years. I was pleasantly surprised when we visited. The staff were friendly and the food was very nice. The atmosphere was a lot better than the last time we visited. I would definatly return again. 
2	 servic was really friendly and helpfull. kids loved there choice of food and how the waitress looked after them. food was niceand filling, we had the fajitas. we all looking forward to going again. 
2	 We have visited this little Italian in Pudsey a few times and have always enjoyed our meals. I can certainly recommend the lobster ravioli 
2	 My family and I first visited the Swan Inn before Christmas. We were a party of 12 - the service was great and all the staff were very friendly. The food was excellent and I think any one would be hard pushed to find a finer carvery for the price anywhere.  We have just gone back for a second visit, and again the service, food etc was excellent.  I think that my husband and I will be making a regular visit for Sunday lunch because it's cheaper than making it yourself plus no washing up! 
2	 I went to this restaurant with my husband for my birthday treat. We had a red letter day given to us last year for our wedding present. Our menu consisting of 7 taster courses. It comes with bread, butter and olives to start , with a glass of bubbly each. Then each individual course came out one by one. The food was good and tasty. The staff are friendly and helpful , so both my husband and I are very happy. 
2	 My young daughters and I had lunch at the Copper Kettle during a short trip to Hunstanton. I recommend the jacket potato with prawns and salad, and the girls seemed very pleased with their pizzas. The little girl at the table next to us had a chocolate milkshake, which looked delicious, and the clientele, a mix of regulars and visitors, all seemed very happy. The staff were working contentedly and efficiently, and the place was busy. I recommend it. 
2	We went to 62 Love Me Do as we're told the burgers were amazing. Unfortunately our order hadn't been ran through with the chef, so we had to wait around 40 minutes before our meals came.  However they were very apologetic and actually didn't charge us a thing for our meal, not even the drinks.  The burgers definitely lived up to their reputation and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
2	 Had a lovely lunch here. Wasn't expecting to get chips and salad with my sandwich but very nice. Nice ambience. Spotless. 
2	 Hooray something really different AND healthy options ! Went for lunch, delicious food , I had something called Shamshuka ... Delicious ..also lots of super food type salads ... They also have normal food too and yummy naughty cakes , so something for everyone really . 
2	 Their Boston Brownies are possibly the best in London, it's a toss up between these and salted caramel! 
2	 Were here for a family wedding, lovely setting, good food and drink. Good use of the whole area, outside for photos and use of all of the upstairs rooms for the wedding party. Downstairs bar a little chilly with the main door always open. 
2	5 of us went here last night. We were seated quickly by a very pleasant young lady. She, along with another waitress, were very friendly and efficient. The 2 young men at the servery were nice as well. The food was very good. I was particularly impressed with the cauliflower and broccoli which was perfectly cooked - not a mushy mess nor under-cooked. I had the pork and beef which was delicious. The only negative was that some of the beef was a bit chewy - I think this was because it was a fresh joint and I got the beginning bit. We hadn't realised it was quiz night but stayed and joined in; which was fun. We didn't win :( I'm at a loss to understand the negative reviews posted; we certainly enjoyed a very pleasant evening with good food, attentive pleasant staff and a lot of reasonably priced wine :D
2	Had an evening meal which was cooked to perfection (Hunter's Chicken). Chose not to have the carvery because they meat had been sitting there being kept warm since the pub opened at 12 pm (6/7 hours). Overcooked and dry is not how I like my meat, so this carvery is definitely not for me, shame as the carvery under the old owners (before July 2015) was something special.
2	 They were wonderful with our baby boy and kept engaging with him in a very pleasant way. Steaks were wonderful and lamb ordered was very tasty! The only downside is the smell that you'll have for the rest of the day stuck to your clothes. Truly recomend... 
2	 You have to go here for the experience/atmosphere not for fast service !! Or Super food maybe I just chose the wrong dish but you live and learn!!  It's a quirkily lilttle establishment that's slightly overrated on the food stakes, I feel.  Brilliant points are the wonderful front of house lady (oriental lady?) didn't get her name but she is a lovey, welcoming hostess and the overall quirky atmosphere of the actual building, the outdoor play space for the children and the quaint little touches of the tea towel napkins and the old diary type judge etc.  The staff (apart from the lady with the incredibly long nails - turquoise that evening!! sorry had to mentioned her as she was so uptight and out of place !) are really laid back and friendly.  This a take your time slow dining evening at it's best !! And the food is good enough not brillanat order a starter if you have hungry children!   More vegetatian options would be welcome.   i doubt they have time to read trip advisor reviews so little will change here as they are trading on their reputation most of all and will continue to get Rave reviews !!  Go for the experience and book so you can savour the entire evening dine!! And yes you order food at the bar, not sure that does them any favours but they must have reason   Also as mentioned parking is difficult as the Old Smithy car park closes at 6 pm so you have to be lucky to get a space in the small car park.  As my toital implies I am not quite sure what this is a pub ? A resterant? so it's that ecclectic,quirky approach that makes for the best.  Would only return if we had made prior booking for 6pm when they open the kitchens and bring some bread rolls for the children. 
2	 My husband son and his girlfriend dined on the 25th August 2014. We all commented on the very good food. The staff were helpful and polite. For the food and drink we purchased the cost was very reasonable. 
2	 Small pub/ restaurant with limited tables so might be a good idea to book. Food is alway good, beautifully presented and interesting with regular menu changes. Good value and not pretentious honest cooking with local ingredients. 
2	 This was our first visit. Great place to go after a hard days shopping. Food, drink and atmosphere really nice. The Lady who looked after us was Samantha, she was Excellent! if she is not the Manager she should be.Thank you very much. When we are next in Birmingham we will be returning for lunch 
2	 we have been several times and the food and choice is always good. The staff are very pleasant and helpfull 
2	Visited Don Pepe's for the first time recently for a friend's 70th Birthday, they have been going there for nearly 50 years. Wonderful fish menu, garlic prawns were very good and Scallops wrapped in bacon were exceptional, extremely well cooked and delicious food. The Restaurant is quirky but well worth visiting for the experience and amazing food.
2	 My mum and I ate here a couple of nights ago and really enjoyed it. Great fresh decor, fast service and really enjoyed our meals. We both had the lobster and crab tagliatelle. Definitely recommend. 
2	Food good, service can be hit and miss if you get a trainee, Daniel Maitre D is excellent, bit pricey but good slick city option
2	 Had to leave a review as I visit here regularly with family and friends. Staff are welcoming and always accommodating. Specials menu is fantastic, I am working my way through it and not once been disappointed! Food is fresh and tasty. I eat in at the restaurant but can also recommend their takeaway service. Thank you for being consistently excellent. 
2	 We ate here tonight in the upstairs room for a birthday meal. The food was delicious especially the chicken liver parfait starter which was fantastic. However, we had had to pay the full price of the meal up front on booking and to preorder our menu choices, so it was quite annoying to have the waiter try to take our food order, and then at the end they gave us a bill for the whole amount, not just the drinks. So we had to wait while they corrected their mistake. Also the live music was a bit dreary. 
2	Had a fab family meal on Saturday night. There were 7 of us including children. Staff were very attentive, helpful and friendly, with a good sense of humour. Food was very tasty and they were happy to suggest dishes once you described the consistency and level of spice you preferred. We received complimentary drinks at the end of the evening and ices for the children. Lovely atmosphere and would certainly recommend it.
2	 Food was nice and a good variety for adults and kids. We visited twice whilst on holiday at Regent Bay holiday Park across the road. Only downside was both times we waited ages to pay. 
2	The Jasmine House is a friendly restaurant on the main road out of Stockport. Serving traditional Chinese dishes and some 'specials', the owner and staff provide good food and a fantastic service, always making customers feel special. Good for Christmas parties and get-togethers, with its spacious upstairs and cosy downstairs, as well as for couples and smaller parties.
2	 Very good value for money!  Started with cocktails, then scotch egg, then fish and chips! Some of the best batter I have tasted and the chips were very different, skins on, and very flavoursome!  All in all, a lovely evening! 
2	 We stopped by as we were cold after a long walk on hove seafront . We were going to have coffees but decided to have a glass of wine. We were told they only serve wine with food so we looked at the menu and shared a dish. It was delicious. And a good way to spend Sunday lunch . 
2	 Booked a table both times - on our last night had asked for a window table but we did not get. Well furnished. Good service overall. Excellent fish - best Hake I have ever had. Love how they run down which fish is available that night - and the unlimited chips! Kid's Squid packs great and good for kids of all ages 
2	 I visited here a few weeks ago with my partner during their happy hour, which is great and runs for so long! Great deals on martini's and wine, fizz etc, I especially loved the passion fruit martini. They also have a lovely food menu which apparently comes from the restaurant upstairs.  Unfortunately although when we arrived a waitress came to our table and put a tab on for us etc, as it got busier she remained the only waitress and people were waiting longer and longer for drinks, at the bar too. I have to say she really tried to make up for it and was a great server but they really need more staff!! Also near the entrance there was a horrific smell of sick that was really offputting.  Hopefully most days its not like that thought, and it is a great venue and great drinks. 
2	 Was our 1st visit here. The food was ok but not fantastic was a little disappointing. Very small portions for the price you pay. However the staff made up for this. Fantastic service from all the staff. Lauren and Lara were amazing. Helped us with whatever we wanted. Such friendly professional staff also the twins behind the bar. Very friendly. 
2	I went here with some friends. they don't do the buffet anymore, but they do a set menu. The food was fantastic, they are under new mangement and are offering more authentic chinese food, although they still do the old favourites as well. I'm veggie but my friends are not. I had lovely bean curd and the baby corn in batter was so good it was stolen by the meat eaters as well. They reported the pork belly was the best they ever had and the mongolian lamb was banging. The staff were friendly and the overall price reasonable.I'd recommend everyone to give it a try. It's nothing like it was before the changes. I'm certainly going back!
2	 The food here is fantastic. Really super tasty, fresh and reasonably priced. The iced Vietnamese coffee is a particular favourite of mine.  However, I can't give it a 5* rating because of the service. It's horribly slow even when not packed. I shouldn't have to spend over an hour in a cafe for a quick lunch. Some of the staff border on rude. Some smiles and transparency regarding the waiting time would be appreciated. 
2	I was staying overnight at a local equestrian venue and had an evening meal which was excellent I would highly recommend it the staff where very friendly
2	Popped in for lunch and ended up having a three course meal. The food is some of the best we've had. The staff are friendly and happy to recommend popular dishes. we only used the pub lunch menu, but still had lots to choose from. we will defo be back to try the restaurant soon.
2	Had a great time at Zizzi, very generous portions of tasty food. Full review here: http://limehawkmoth.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/zizzi-the-triangle-manchester-review/
2	 We opted for Afternoon Tea, as we were visiting Manchester for the Corrie Tour, like others we thought it was fitting to go to the restaurant that Fizz owns. It was my mum's first experience of an Afternoon Tea, and she was thoroughly delighted with it. The tea was by far the best point, with the traditional strainer and china tea cup, sandwiches were a good variety, the cakes were lovely, although for the price I felt that they both could have been of better quality. The restaurant itself is lovely, and spotless, the waiting staff were very attentive. 
2	 Went for dinner and decided yo stay over as a really nice feel to the place. Staff very friendly and welcolming manager Justin was really enthusiastic about the place and didnt seem to be concerned they were quiet on a saturday night as he sees a big picture for this lovely hotel and wether its packed out or just the two of us in the bar with the dogs a warm fire candels all alight nice food and lovely wine list is what you will get howling wind and rain outside but tucked up in our comfy comfy bed in a traditionaly decorated room (possibly a bit ostentaisious and dated) we felt incredibly well looked after and slept really well breakfast was amazing like domthing ypu wpuld expect on a cruise ship!! Kippers were on the menu which is lovely but i didnt have them went for the eggs royal which was perfect husband had the full english would stay again but look foward to seeing their changes thanks team kings head 
2	 Food was excellent, as was the atmosphere. I thought the food and wine were a bit overpriced so wouldn't class it as a regular dining experience, more a one-off for special occasions. 
2	 Been a couple of time to this restaurant - excellent food, reasonably priced, well-presented food, friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere. A really good place to go with friends! 
2	 It took a while to be served due to the amount of customers but it was certainly worth waiting for. We had the cheese and broccoli soup (delicious) and the chicken pie (huge). 
2	 Really great burgers I was not disappointed. Fantastic rosemary fries too I would definitely go again. The waiter also made the effort to introduce himself, he explained he was learning English and if we had any feedback for him. Very sweet and friendly! And fantastic food, you just feel a little like you're sitting in a weird guys basement as its a little dark haha! 
2	 The staff were very friendly, food was great and a served very quickly, lovely place. Great place for lunch after you have been to Tintagel castle. 
2	Popped in for a quick lunch on the way to Thursford Christmas Spectacular. Excellent service and food in a nice tidy environment. Very good value.
2	Make sure your hungry the food portions are huge. Would definitely go back again. the service was also excellent.
4	 great place to get something to eat and a really friendly atmosphere! staff were friendly and its very clean. highly recommended! 
4	 Excellent, friendly service and very helpful. Melon was not on the menu as a starter but my husband asked if melon was available and they were very obliging and went and got him some. Thank you for that. 
4	 Being going here for over 20 years and food has always been excellent along with welcoming staff and a good varied choice of Indian food. If you are fan of Tandori dishes chicken tikka is 2nd to none and probably the best I have ever had anywhere. Tandori fish is also excellent. would recommend to anyone. 
4	 We are having to ration our visits as we would tend to go here all the time because it always feels like we are on holiday. Lovely food, great staff and great atmosphere. I think we will be there on Sunday, cant wait. 
4	The most tasteful Dishes. Excellent value. Very friendly staff. Such a large menus to choose from. Good clean facilities.
4	 We were really looking forward to another meal here and were not disappointed. Chef, James, continues to offer a fabulous plate of food, sourced locally, with perfect presentation and such good value for money. His home made bread was divine. We have attached photos of the first courses of the scallops and the squid rings. We both had the hake for our main course, which was delicious and perfectly cooked. We apologise for the absence of photos of both of the desserts - we ate without delay and thoroughly enjoyed the delights of the chocolate and the olive polenta cake. We will be back to sample again and will try harder to capture the breads and both of our desserts on camera! 
4	 We stopped here for a coffee whilst on way to bristol it was very quaint and traditional, staff very friendly and helpful and saw to all our needs. Thoroughly enjoyed my coffee experience so much that we came back whilst travelling back home would def recommend to others and re visit when we can. 
4	 Came here for my husband's 40th, service was spot on, friendly staff and food was divine.  Thank you for a wonderful time. 
4	 We went here due to reviews on Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed! It's like a museum of toys and other things from your childhood and the food was really good too! The owners were really friendly too. we nearly didn't go because the road is closed at the moment but there is a pay and display carpark on Beck Hill, 2 minutes walk from there, that was perfect and it was definitely worth the effort. Really recommend it to anyone looking for a good café in Bridlington 
4	 I held a celebration party at this restaurant for 36 people and used the upstairs dining area. We had a fantastic night and cannot speak more highly of Gianni and his staff. The food was very good - not one person could find fault with it and the service was efficient, friendly and swift.   Gianni had organised everything as requested by me and ensured my evening went perfectly. I can't thank him and his staff enough for such a wonderful celebration party.  We will all definitely be back 
4	 Came here a few weeks ago on a tuesday evening. When we arrived we were the only people in the restaurant which was odd because it's normally very busy!  The buffet wasn't on because of it being quiet, so we ordered from the menu. It was 2 for 1 on dishes so we ordered a selection, and i can honestly say it was the best indian i have had! Everything from the flavours in the curries we ordered, to the presentation of everything, it was all spot on!  The service was brilliant, and the restaurant owner is a real credit, he is brilliant!  Definitely recommend Tandoori Parlour!! 
4	 I've had lunch from CJ's about 4 times now. The service has always been really friendly, with staff being happy to accommodate requests, or offer suggestions on complimentary flavours.  While the prices are a little high for me to be able to afford every day - each wrap/flatbread I have had has been full with a really generous portion of filling. It's like a small meal rather than a light bite, so well worth the money. 
4	 Gigantic portions, lovely service. I would never expect food to be soooooo good, beautifully served. Nice ambiance. I loved everything there. I thought it would be a regular pub food, gosh, how wrong I was! :-) highly recommended! 
4	 Fantastic fish n chips. Not a stingy portion which I appreciate. We were asked if we minded sitting upstairs during a busy lunch which worried me, but it was lovely and airy up there too. Definately come again. 
4	I could not believe the beauty of this house. So much to see. You can easily make a day of it and maybe a bit more the next day. Fabulous restaurants, fantastic history of the house and stunning gardens to explore.
4	 Cheaters made our day out. We had the freshest, loveliest, most colourful salads and delicious quiche/soup. My relative suggested that we should book a holiday cottage nearby for a week in the spring so we can eat there everyday. We decided that we'd need the fire brigade to come round and take down the wall to let us out as we'd be too fat to get through the door. We will be back. Again and again and again. Thanks Chesters. 
4	Came here first thing in the morning during a weekday. Very generous portions with the full English breakfast. Very good value for money
4	 I love this Jamie's Italian, the staff are always attentive the food is always perfect, and we are always seated very quickly. I prefer this venue to other Jamie's Italians as this one is set in the guildhall. 
4	 First time to this cafe & we had a really great meal. We both had the salt & pepper prawns which were lovely & fresh. Excellent friendly service. Would recommend as a nice place for lunch. 
4	Just been to the Horseshoe at Sywell for a meal and thought it was great! The food was lovely (excellent chef!), service absolutely spot on and the general pub ambience was very pleasant. Would highly recommend!!
4	 We go to Cafe Naaz quite regularly and cannot fault the place ... A fantastic evening out; lovely atmosphere, lovely food and great service. What more can you ask for? 
4	 A lovely visit throughout. Our grandchildren are now vegetarian and were very well catered for. I enjoyed the roast pork which was so tender it melted in the mouth. We have been before and will go again. 
4	 Went here for the first time on Saturday - don't know why I've never been before but I will definitely be back! We had the afternoon tea and every bit of it was beautiful - the bread for the sandwiches was lovely and fresh, the homemade cakes and scones were some of the best I've ever had. There is also a great selection of teas, and although it was busy, we never felt rushed. Great visit, I highly recommend! 
4	The Turkey Cafe in my opinions if the best bar in Leicester. The cocktails are amazing and creative, there is something for everyone! My favourite include &quot;Blue army bramble&quot;, &quot;Im in love with the coco (cocopops cocktail!) and &quot;The Refresher&quot; (has an actual ice lolly in it). The bar has a lovely relaxed yet sophisticated feel to it. Staff are extremely helpful when it comes to helping you choose something to drink, and definitely know their stuff. There is no where like Turkey Cafe, it is simply the best in town.
4	 Fantastic food and service. A lovely family run Italian restaurant. This is not a chain. It was our 3rd time and again I had a lovely meal. A must visit x 
4	We went here for lunch a few days ago as we were staying nearby for Christmas. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. The ambience and decor were lovely. The food was very good!
4	 I have visited here twice since it reopened. The food is delicious, and as fan of Chinese food, I must say it is up there with some of the best. Definitely worth a visit! 
4	Good food, good food, good food, good food, good food, good food, good food, what else can I say. Oh yes, the food is good.
4	Now I don't purport to be an expert in Thai food but this place was recommended to us and we were blown away by the Pad Thai and the Red Curry. Loved the quirky incongruous setting, sitting as we did next to a huge collection of whiskies in what us essentially a good local pub. We'll be back and bringing people with us.  
4	 Fraser and his staff at the Thatch, really know the meaning of customer service. They have managed to make the Thatch a one-stop shop for many people living in Thame by really going the extra mile to give the customer what they want. As a result it is a fabulous place to go for a lunch, dinner or party night, or simply a drink or a coffee. When I was trying to find somewhere that could offer an afternoon tea on Father's Day but wasn't able to get there till 6pm, they provided exactly that, saying we could have tea, brunch, dinner, or whatever we would like! (Unlike the Spread Eagle up the road who refused to offer an afternoon tea after 3pm that afternoon!) When we walked past on a snowy morning with a pile of children and a couple of dogs, we were welcomed in to thaw out by the fire with hot chocolate and toast. And last week's Grown Up Party night with live music was a roaring success with a wonderfully welcoming atmosphere.   Well done to all at the Thatch for showing the competition how it could be done. 
4	 Great food and super staff the best curry. The decoor is very nice vibrant red. The staff is amazing 
4	 The food was delicious and the portion sizes were generous. Excellent. friendly service. Very reasonable price. Will definitely be back! 
4	 good food, freshly cooked, good service friendly staff, easy access............................................................................................... 
4	 Took my mum for an informal birthday tea - wonderful food, excellent personal service and they went the extra mile by preparing an impressive carved fruit swan on the house for my mum with candles. She was over the moon, it was a lovely thoughtful surprise & made her feel really special. The restaurant is excellent value. I had the £7.95 two couse special offer - hummous & moussaka which was delicious. We had olives to munch while waiting for starters and ordered two portions as they were so cheap we assumed they would be normal portions - when they arrived each portion was over 3 times a normal portion size & they were delicious. Mum had the specials for both starters & mains - ribs with pomegranate sauce and pork roll with cauliflower mash & asparagus both of which were really tasty & cooked to perfection. We also had really nice wine which had to be the nicest Shiraz I've had. All in all, extremely impressed. We will definitely be back & I would recommend it to anyone. 
4	 Wanted to celebrate my birthday locally, and found Mattoni's via Tripadvisor. Well the reviews weren't wrong! A lovely welcome, superb food made to order, and the place had a friendly atmosphere even in the middle of the week. Everyone was extremely happy, thank you. 
4	 Just the best hospitality that anyone would wish for when organising your sons surprise 21st. Balloons and cake that's what you need. Then a delicious banquet of different starters and mains. Thank you to Danu and staff for being so intensive and providing me with memories that will last decades. 1st Class, Thank you. 
4	Although it was very busy Hannah was great. Nothing too much trouble and very efficient. The food was excellent and the sticky toffee roulade is to die for.
4	 Loved this place, great atmosphere (even at 6:30pm on a Monday!) and the food was delicious. Some really fab dishes to choose from and every single one was perfectly prepared. Would definitely recommend! 
4	Booked a meal due to reviews on Tripadvisor and wasn't disappointed. Food was excellent. Wide choice and very reasonably priced. The staff was friendly. Would recommend giving it a go if your in the area.
4	 Great food (Gluten Free option available) in a nice place. My boyfriend had chicken liver & foie gras parfait as a starter and roasted pork belly for main. I had fish, homemade gravadlax and roasted English cod loin (I'm the Coeliac one). I definitively recommend the cod loin, and the Creme Brulee too! It's quite expensive, but it's perfect for special occasions. We'll come back! 
4	 The service was excellent, as well as the food -made of premium quality products. I also liked the music and the friendly environment. The best part was the home-made like food. I tried ''pork a la greque&quot; which is served with chips and Greek salad. The wine also was very good. 
4	I have been going every morning to get a coffee from here (I work next door) and I cannot recommend it more. You get a very friendly chat while waiting for your coffee and they are extremely quick. Also if you have a loyalty card every 10th coffee is free :) They also know your order very quickly - pretty sure I became a regular after 2 days!
4	The best Authentic Chinese dishes in Oxford in no frills setting. Fast and courteous service. Thai dishes also great.
4	My husband and I came here with some friends that live nearby, and we absolutely loved it. All of the mezze was delicious, especially the calamari. I had salmon for my main course and it was perfect. I recommend sitting outside when the weather is warm enough as there is a lovely view of the lock. The service is incredibly friendly as the chef and the owner came out to talk to us. They even gave us some pointers on how to make the calamari (apparently you soak it in beer overnight). Will definitely come back.
4	 17th of December 2014. We arrived at the Bricklayers early on Sunday evening and were greeted by a very polite Front of House/Manager Michael who was more than welcoming! we enjoyed a wonderful three course meal and myself and my fellow diners opted for the Mini navarin of lamb shoulder with a lamb cutlet on a mixed cèpes mash with a ratatouille Jus - what can I say this was delicious and cooked to perfection an dit would have been simply rude not to have participated in the pudding 'Hot sticky toffee pudding with date mascarpone'. Alvin and his team have worked hard to create a fantastic country dining venue which is simply a must visit over Christmas and during 2015. Excellent wine, Food and atmosphere and even a good website to refer to http://www.bricklayersarms.com, we will be returning very soon. Michele Brooks Chesham Buckinghamshire 
4	 First time we tried this tonight on a friends recommendation. Will definitely be having this delivered again and will definitely be going to have a meal in the restaurant! ! Absolutely delicious! Thank you very much 
4	 Amazing food, taste, service. I hadn't been for a few years but a well enjoyed family meal. Will definitely be going more often.   
4	 We went out with my husbands parents in Worcester and had heard some good reviews about Bottles so we gave it a go. Nice atmosphere, quirky, helpful friendly staff. Will go again being a wine lover it's an ideal place to go. 
4	 Recently visited with friends and family (group of 9) and the service was impeccable. Even though it was Christmas eve we were seated quickly and the service was prompt. A really enjoyable atmosphere. 
4	 This restaurant is fabulous. We've visited twice now with about a 2 yr gap inbetween and both times the steaks with blue cheese sauce have been simply amazing. Well worth a visit. 
4	 I don't usually write reviews but I pop into bakehouse most days of my week during my break or after work. The coffee is the best I ever have and the cakes are pretty damn good! I love the food that is served downstairs (especially the paprika hummus and sourdough bread, and the chips are. to. die. for) but I'm not sure food downstairs is served now?  Anyway, 10/10 for bakehouse and the kind staff! 
4	 Had the Friday fish and chips . Well cooked nicely served and very quick too. Really homely place with welcoming fireplace . Friendly staff - definitely will go back on the next trip to Skipton Market . 
4	I live in Farnsfield, and love to eat at the Lion especially on a Sunday, their Sunday Roast is fab. Mid week I op for their locally sourced burger, and at lunch their fish platter. But most of all I love that I can sit either in the bar or outside with my dog, after a long walk in the county side...bliss
4	 Me and my boyfriend visited this lovely place on Thursday for my birthday dinner. We shared the antipasto sardo and the tagliolini with king prawns and bottarga and then we had the lamb off the specials and the rib-eye steak, all accompanied by a bottle of Tanca Farra, an amazing Sardinian red. The food was to die for and the service efficient and friendly, in true Sardinian style. We can wait to come back to Newcastle to visit again. 
4	 We popped into the Sun Inn half expecting there to not be a table available for us given that it was a Saturday evening. However, the staff were very accommodating and showed us to a table in the restaurant. Great ambience, lovely staff and great food at a reasonable price. Would highly recommend if you are in the Hawkshead area. 
4	 I was blown away on several levels .. The setting of the recently converted Royal William Yard is magnificent .. and the position of this restaurant particularly good with a sea view. I am Vegetarian so having more than one option is fabulous and we were not disappointed .. all three courses were spectacular, in fact when looking for a restaurant for Easter Sunday we went back with the family for the Sunday lunch ! The staff had clearly been well recruited and made both visits events to be talked about .. our friends, who live locally have already been back again! 
4	 High recommended. All staff welcoming. I couldn't believe they allowed dogs, children and muddy boots welcome, that is so true. New play area for the children they loved it. Had a lovely meal in the beer garden and we could even take our family dog with us. Want to thank the staff for making us feel welcome , ,What a cracking weekend. Booked for next year already. 
4	Had a fantastic luncheon on Friday 29 January 2016... everyone (8 of us) thoroughly enjoyed our food and I completely cleared my plate; would recommend the Pheasant with celeariac and kale 100%... Lovely food and ambiance enhanced by attentive and polished staff..10/10 .
4	 I went to the Croft with my husband and my parents on Sunday. The meal was unbelievable. The attention to deail with the combination of flavours was exquisit. I had the blowtourched salmon which was a very unsual method of cooking, but it completely melted in your mouth and was clearly excellent quality fish. I would highly recommend it. Excellent 
4	 We eat in the red lion regularly and the food and service is always spot on (unlike other local establishments!). I always like the puddings - the syrup sponge is usually a winner ☺️  We went on Wednesday to try the 'pie and pudding night' for the first time and thought we should write a review to flag it up for others in the area (it was lovely and great value for money at £10.95). I had fish pie and my partner had beef and guineas pie - both were homemade and delicious.   We were offered a wide choice of puddings (syrup sponge, sticky toffee, chocolate pudding). We chose chocolate pudding and sticky toffee pudding, again they were awesome and we struggled to fit it all in - definitely worth a vist, we will definitely be back! 
4	 A gem of a place. Unique, stylish and very friendly. So welcoming to children and dogs too. The breakfast is the best in Plymouth- no competition. 
4	Lovely food my special favourite is shell fish risotto but have tried many other dishes. As a couple we like to sit upstairs during very busy times but it also really nice to have a glass of wine and leisurely lunch outside, when the weather permits and watch the world go by.
4	 Lovely food the homemade granny chips are lovely. Good selection of cakes with big scones and yummy rocky roads. Good place to eat lovely and friendly very up to date cafe. 
4	 We had our Christmas meal here on December 13th and I must say I had some reservations due to the takeover. We had a very successful meal here last year. I was not disappointed it was lovely the staff were really attentive the food was lovely and the price was perfect. Not one of the party of 21 had anything negative to say. I'd like to say a big thank you and I am sure it will continue to improve. good luck to Steve and all the gang for looking after us so well. We will be coming back next year! 
4	 I have recently dined at the Camberley Tandori with my family to celebrate my birthday. I was looking forward to trying the Dinner menu, as I previously had only tried the lunch menu that not only affordable but also quick and enjoyable.  The dinner was not only Delicious but the service we received was welcoming, efficient and very accommodating. The staff made an extra fuss over my birthday which was greatly appreciated.  I feel that this restaurant is reasonably priced, welcoming and a is truly a hidden gem in an area that otherwise, in my opinion, does not have an establishment that matches this level of service and appetizing food.   I would highly recommend The Camberley Tandori to everyone. 
4	 I had an amazing time at santino the food was incredible and the staff were very friendly but not too in your face, lovely restaurant I will defiantly be paying another visit shortly. 
4	 A great country pub with a great atmosphere. Close to Dunham Massey Hall and Gardens and a great point for joining the canal towards Lymm.  The staff are friendly and the food is always great. They also do a great Sunday Lunch.  Popular with families of all ages, walkers and dog owners. All are welcome.  If you visit you will not be disappointed. 
4	 On entry to the restaurant we were greeted by a member of staff and asked if we had booked... We had, upon recommendation that it may be busy!    We were shown to our table and then set about the task of choosing which burger we were all going to have, there are soo many it took a while as all sound appetising and really reasonably priced ranging from £7-£9.   After ordering it's then that you really take in the atmosphere, it's very relaxed with low tables and kegs to sit on, retro artwork and current music. To top it off they have games rooms ! Table tennis and Sega to keep you entertained.   When the food came out I think we might have actually gasped ! The burgers were massive and really well presented. They tasted just as good as they looked. We had sweet potato fries on the side which I have to say are the best I've tried although a pound more than the regular fries at £3.50, they were worth it.  The cocktails were also fab and at £6.50 are competetively priced.The ruby cooler would be my recommendation.   The staff were amazing throughout both the waiting staff and the bar staff were polite and attentive. Nothing was too much hassle.  Burgerfest is definitely worth a visit and I am positive that they will ensure that you will return. 
4	 My boyfriend and I decided to try a takeaway from here last month and we were really impressed. So hard to find a decent Indian around and we didn't have one fault with our dinner. Highly recommended. Will be ordering again very soon!!.:) 
4	 john and helen did the catering and ran the bar for my wedding.they also did the wake for my uncle in the duke a couple of weeks ago and it was faultless,food was spot on and they really looked after us.a lovely pub with a friendly atmosphere and superb food.lovely beer garden too and great location.would definately recommend. 
4	 Mm absolutely delicious, we had scrambled egg and smoked salmon on crumpets, they were very nice. Coffee was very nice too, enjoyed watching the world go by on a lovely sunny morning. The owners are very friendly and like to make sure that you are happy with your meal. Would definitely recommend. 
4	 How to create an atmosphere like New Years Eve on a cold Sunday in November? Simple - just add the beautiful surroundings of Adrianos, great food, lovely staff and the energetic antics of Jason Isaacs. It's a must if you're looking for an alternative Sunday night experience :) 
4	 On the night of the Annual Carnival we popped into Urchins early so we could get a seat and I had the best Calamari I have had in years. The staff are informal, helpful and very welcoming the owners are very professional and nothing is too much to ask. I recommend this restaurant a lot to customer's who visit my shop and believe we are very lucky in Bude to have it. 
4	 I go to Chilacas often (normally on a Wednesday) and every time that I have been I have absolutely loved the food, the atmosphere and the staff have always been wonderful.  After having tried all of the burritos, my favourite is the pork - very tasty - and I'd recommend the chipotle sauce. I've also had the nachos which are also delicious, especially with the salsa which is exactly how a salsa should be (bits chunks of tomato and onion not a weird runny sauce). It is great value for money and, as someone who eats out a lot, it is a great alternative to the other more expensive restaurants in Brindley Place. Also, there are always deals going and you can get a loyalty card (and then a free drink!).  It is a great place to grab a quick bite if you're in a hurry or to sit down, relax and enjoy the atmosphere with a nice cold corona or one of their delicious cocktails.  Couldn't recommend this place more. The staff are always attentive and the food is always tasty! 
4	 We went on a Monday evening, we went for the buffet ,it was excellant Good service as usual even though very busy 
4	 Finding myself in Bournemouth for work on a Saturday, I thought about where to head for supper. Having heard of Cosy Club's back home in Somerset, thought we would give it a go. After ringing at 5, they told me they were pretty packed but could fit me in around 6:30 or 9:30 - so we took the earlier time. The staff were really friendly, helpful and gave all the information required about the food etc. We choose some lovely cocktails (gin of course!) and decided to go for the burger with the macaroni cheese patty and we were not disappointed. Managed to squeeze in a sticky toffee pudding as well which was again lovely. Would recommend heading there if you're stuck in the center of Bournemouth. 
4	 The food is outstanding as is the service. Book ahead, it's VERY popular! Authentic Italian cuisine at its best. 
4	 Fab food fab cocktails fab staff ! We arrived 1 hour early but were quickly accommodated by the staff. Will definitely return when I'm next in the city . 
4	 A fantastic family gathering at a most delightful country pub. Everything, from the warmth of the welcome, to the breadth of the menus (a la carte, light bite and specials) to the comfort of the surroundings shouts quality here. Although we had booked for the restaurant, we settled in a cosy nook in the bar for pre-lunch drinks and there we decided to remain. Just a hop and a skip from Pickering and well worth the journey. Highly recommended. Do check out the menus. 
4	 Excellent meal would recommend to anyone. Especially the Lemon cheese cake. And the Cambridge sausages are to die for. 
4	 Wonderful Japanese food, equal to many pricier west end establishments. From the salads to the soft shell crab, delicious and beautifully presented. 
4	 Excellent food especially the 'too die for' mushroom starters! Generous portions and great value for money. Enjoyable, friendly atmosphere in comfortable restaurant area and they even allow dogs in the public bar area (where you can have your restaurant food if you wish). All this makes it a lovely welcoming, relaxing environment and the food is divine as well. What more could you want !!! 
4	Food was excellent and you couldn't ask for better service. Polite, friendly staff who were attentive and accommodating. We had the Rogun Josh and Vindaloo. Will be going back for more!
4	 Excellent meals served in warm and comfortable surroundings in this busy Lakeland pub. Friendly staff. 
4	 Stayed at a local b&b on a birthday weekend visit to the IOW. Booked the table on spec. Superb food, wonderful selection & presentation. Ample portions. Good flavours too. Staff were helpful & accommodating. Service was swift. Would like to revisit to sample as many dishes as possible. Well done the Fox family. 
4	 I been living on Brick Lane for about 30 years now and funnily enough I don't normally like curry. However my friends from Asia came over for a visit and they really wanted a curry so they could compare it to the curries they get at home. So we decided to walk along brick lane centre of indian and Bangladeshi food to find a slap up curry. Eventually we came across Cinnamon. It was amazing. It totally made me love curry and I have decided to make it a monthly thing. The staff are also really welcoming and charming which made the vibe really fun. I would recommend the coconut honey chicken curry it is delicious. 
4	 I highly recommend 'Duke Street Style Egg's' for any meal of the day! The most amazing combination of flavours and textures, beautufully presented and very filling!  My partner had the full english and was equally impressed.  The staff were also super friendly and very accomodating. The place was clean, fresh and very relaxing - a perfect start to our day!   Definitly try this place!! 
4	 This restraunt has books! Yay! Good books. Good food. Nice staff. Not too expensive. Cheap and yummy, cheap and interesting! 
4	 July26/7/2012.We have just come back from having a excellent lunch the food was very cooked and presented.The staff were very friendly we went with friends who really enjoyed it .Thank you to every one well worth a visit. from Mr&mrs Blackwell & Mr&mrs norrman. 
4	Excellent tea in the lounge - great service and all round lovely experience , made all the better by not being rushed - superb Darjeeling , delicious cakes and tasty sandwiches made it the perfect birthday treat for a group of friends....
4	 Good choice of menu. Excellent service. Value for money. Trip advisor insists I say more but feel this summarises my experience. 
4	 From the moment we stepped through the door everything was perfect. Bottle of water including tap offered immediately, closely followed by a breadboard with various breads. Order was taken shortly after. My partner had the crayfish and salmon salad and I had the seabass with fondant potatoes and vegetables.  Total bill including cider and fruit juice was £20.00 (lunch menu). This restaurant is like a well oiled machine, from front of house to the chefs in the kitchen.  Highly recommended. If you visit Canterbury be sure to try it...but don't take a chance......book first even for lunch. 
4	 We came to the charity evening at Thompsons on Monday evening, it happened to coincide with our son's birthday. We had a wonderful evening, the food was without fault, even our son, who as a twelve year old can be a fussy eater, devoured everything. Despite the fact the restaurant was fully booked the service was impeccable and Phil found the time to send a birthday card out to our table and a birthday cake with candle. A perfect birthday celebration and lovely to be able to combine this with such a worthwhile cause as the hospice. 
4	 We came across this place more by chance, very quaint with all its hanging baskets outside. Staff seemed very friendly, we had one of there sandwiches with a basket of chips!! ( prawn and crayfish and ham cheese and pickle!)  We came back the second day for a drink and managed to get one of the tables outside! You have to early!! Very popular pub just off the main hustle and bustle of the centre of Windsor! Highly recommend. 
4	the food here is very good. Both the vegetarian and non veg dishes are excellent. We will definitely come back here again. The service isnt too great but the food speaks for itself.
4	 Me and a few friends went for the New Year's Eve party and was very impressed, the food was absolutely amazing, the staff were great too. Thank you for a great evening and a good start to 2016. 
4	 Excellent food choice and very high quality , always something different to try , dog friendly which is great , however never enough tables , often been and had to have take out as no where to sit :( however food so good always buy something , really friendly staff ., 
4	 It took me a while to try their food. It is absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend the homemade crumpets. 
4	 Came here with a party of 20 for afternoon tea to celebrate my parents' Golden Wedding Anniversary and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the decor inside the restaurant having not visited since childhood (30+ years ago) when I remember it being very different! We were extremely well catered for and attended to and the warm scones with clotted cream and jam were delicious. After we had finished eating we were moved to a lounge area where we were free to continue celebrating in a more relaxed atmosphere. A great time was had by all. Definitely worth a visit and we plan to return for lunch or an evening meal. 
4	Real tea of all kinds, wonderful cakes and sandwiches. Thoroughly recommend it. Loved the decor, food and tea. Nothing that I disliked.
4	 We arrived not having booked, at a very busy time, but the staff were very friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious too. 
4	 Wanted to try a special place, here we go to &quot;Le Pont de la Tour&quot;.  My cousin suggested it and my co-workers and my Manager loved it and enjoyed the food.  Elegant but warm and cozy place, with an outstanding view.   All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the world, which are pricey but worth sampling.   Great staff, polite, welcoming, very kind and helpful. A special thank you however to Luca, the Headwaiter who was so friendly and wonderful.   I recommend this place – it's fancy but reasonable, inventive but precise.  Thanks 
4	I've alwwanted to eat her but never had to chance to until my mum suprised me for my birthday. The food was just mouth watering. The service was amazing! I got given a free house bbq sauce by the waitresses that was serving us for my birthday which I absolutely love. I will definitely going back to try some more of Red's True amazing food!!
4	 We stumbled across this little place without background knowledge and sat in the lovely little garden for a proper Cornish cream tea. It was so good - we were back 2 days later for another! Most amazing scones that I have ever tasted - their lightness meant that you could justify that extra dollop of clotted cream on it! Thank you. We'll be back 
4	 This has been our local for 15 years and the current management is the best yet! Definitely book if want to eat here at weekends and in winter but during week in Summer can usually just turn up if a small group because there is now a large gaden area. Children loved the band on jubilee weekend and keep asking to go back. The £12-50 3 course menu (including glass of vino) on a Monday is a great way to get rid of the start of week blues. The menu changes, some great starters (prawn and smoked salmon recommended) and the burgers are superb although very filling so do leave room for pudding - chocolate fondant and cheesecakes recommended! 
4	 We wanted to go somewhere nice for a catch up, this restaurant was recommended to my brother by a colleague, and it was outstanding. Service was attentive and knowledgeable but not overpowering, the decor is stylish but not overdone, the food was A-mazing.... The Karahi Gosht (lamb dish) was simply devine, that's it with the superlatives.....go try it, you won't be disappointed 
4	My husband and I visited The Annexe last night (28/03/12) after searching the internet for somewhere new to try and finding it top of the list at Tripadvisor. One word, GORGEOUS! The staff were amazing, friendly and helpful. Our bill came to around £115, but we did enjoy a £30 bottle of wine and the drinks recommended on the menu to suit the desserts (it was a special occaision! Just wanted to point out that without these 'treats' three courses for two would have been under £50!) If I could give one bit of advice it would be to try the scallops!! Stunning! I enjoyed the scallops, followed by the steak (cooked to perfection), my hubby had the pork confit followed by the duck (equally as nice as mine). I fully enjoyed the cheese board afterwards, whilst hubby had a very enjoyable dessert. I read 3 pages of reviews here and still expected the worst before arriving, but I cannot recommend it more. We will be back again and again and again............
4	As ever this landlord (Tim) never fails to impress. The great year around pub atmosphere was finished of with a bang during the 'cartoon superhero' fancy dress new year party. Starting with the generosity of 'help-yourself' food, to homemade punch, strobe lighting and a disco until ~3/4am. This has to have been one of the best new years and birthdays ever. And of course, Tim's lively personality made the night.   I strongly recommend this pub for reliable, excellent quality food all year around, as well as a great night out. You don't need a club when you've got an event at the yew tree!
4	 We had breakfast downstairs twice during our stay. Both times the very friendly staff greeted us, seated us and were attentive the whole time. They cater really well for children (although the plates could be cooler for little ones) and will try to accommodate exactly what you want. The pancakes were the best I've ever tasted, were very hot and huge! The eggs Royale were also excellent and I wouldn't hesitate to order again. My biggest dilemma will be whether to have the pancakes or eggs royale!! We can't wait to go back to Boscombe so we can go back there to eat and perhaps take our dog with us too. 
4	 We went on a Saturday night without a booking - they were very busy but found us a table. Service was a little slow because they were so busy BUT they apologised for being slow, were courteous to a tee and the food was A M A Z I N G. The best Chinese food I have ever tasted! 
4	 Relaxed atmosphere, good choice of beers and the best pizza since we were in Rome.  Thin crust, tasty tomato sauce and baked in a wood fired oven. Really enjoyed this place. 
4	 Great views. Great coffee, Great cakes You can sit outside or inside on street level or downstairs by the path to the cliff railway. 
4	 Fab indian, the quality of meat is to die for. They give good portion sizes and are so attentive. Cater for all party sizes. The complimentary drinks afterwards are a good touch. They definitely remember regular visitors and give extra attention.   The food is always perfect and piping hot and I just love the mango chutney that comes with the poppadoms.  Really lovely place, the staff are genuinely helpful and polite and the food is fantastic.  Not overly pricey either.  Ample parking/ near bus+tube stops.   What more could you want???? 
4	 Great place, lovely food, welcoming staff. What made my visit, being wheat intolerant was the wide range of food for me to tuck into, well worth a visit. Sue, leicester. 
4	 Came in on Tuesday evening with some friends. The staff were friendly, discrete and attentive contributing to our wonderful experience. The waitress Emma was particularly helpful in explaining the specials and recommendations. The food was delicious, staff were brilliant, clearly very well run. Will be back soon! 
4	 Staff are very accommodating and dedicated - a Nandos with a difference, feel more than a fast food diner. 
4	 I was not feeling particularly inspired to cook dinner and Pizza Mondays at Strada, Horsham came to my rescue. My husband and I had a relaxing night out and he enjoyed his Parma pizza while I had the spicier Vesuvio; simple, yummy and good value for money. The staff were friendly and attentive and service was fast. Shoutout to the manager, Luis and his team for the great service! :) Would definitely return soon! 
4	 This has got to be the best takeaway in bedworth the food is delicious lots of exotic flavour and nice blends to the curry i would give it 10 out of 10 if your from bedworth or anywhere near by i suggest u visit and get yourself a takeaway and have a nice night in with your family with a curry from massla house and switch netflix on you wont be dissapointed will be back for more !!!! 
4	 I booked the reservation a month prior to the date through the website but found it only had limited times on a given date so call them instead to get a much better options.  I found the reception very pleasant to deal with and attentive by calling and e-mailing the reservation. We found the ambience to be buzzy and cosmopolitan as you'd expect from one of London's premier and popular restaurants. Initially we was scared that it was going to be quiet and pretentious but it was further from our fears. Everything matched the vibrant but cool decor.   The 'experience' was amazing. The food and drink list was easy to decipher and the staff were accommodating to any questions we had and even know Japanese which was a touch.  Perfect for what we wanted and perfect if you want Pan-Asian food but don't know what to order as they do taster menus.  Really enjoyable!!! 
4	 Had a fantastic meal here. The restaurant was lovely an old cinema with beautiful decor. The food was excellent and the staff couldn't do enough. I had a belated birthday meal and Faz was brilliant he bought a birthday cake out for me. Would go again and would recommend it. 
4	What a treat, the landlady, Jane, had laid on Macadam & Piano De Feu, wonderful father and daughter piano act from France. Live in the market square. So lucky to have such quirky live music in a beautiful rural setting, on a balmy summer evening. This 14th century inn is well worth a visit .
4	 Wonderfully quirky half cafe half vinyl store. Friendly and helpful staff, wonderful drinks and pies :) A small clothing section too (I bought myself a Pie & Vinyl jumper). Would recommend :) 
4	I have eaten at Café Calabrese on few occasions, and each time I've been hugely impressed. The service is excellent, the food in simply divine, and reasonably priced. This restaurant is an absolute gem. Highly recommended. Elaine
4	 The first thing that strikes you about Tom is his friendly and at the same time dynamic character which is totally infectious! The detailed description of his meals (there being no menu available) made you want to sample each and every one there and then.  The food was exquisite. The pies and vegetables were to die for, homemade and unique. I was even provided with a sample of another menu choice as a taster.  The combination of Toms friendly banter combined with the excellence of the dishes makes this a must location to visit. Thank you Tom, will definitely be back and recommend you. 
4	Just had an amazing meal here with my family. The staff were so friendly and great with the children. The food was delicious!! Will definitely be coming back again.
4	Amazing french cuisine served by lovely individuals. Small restaurant and so very personal. Extra touches and finishes went a long way. Highly recommend the frogs legs and crepes!  Also provide a very nice menu of the day until 7pm which is extremely good value!
4	You know how you wish you had a cosy little bistro at the end of your road that delivers delicious, proper, seasonal food every time you visit? Well, we have that restaurant in Friends! My husband and I go whenever we have something (or nothing) to celebrate when we can't face going further afield, or just want a lovely, local evening. The food is all made in their kitchen, and is faultless, the wine list is excellent and the service is impeccable. It's pretty quiet and cosy though - better for a jolly evening with a few friends or a romantic dinner than a raucous evening with a crowd. I am a food writer so can be pretty fussy but I never have a single complaint at Friends, only a super time.
4	Whenever we're coming to London, we always book a table here for dinner. Four of us eat here last Saturday and it was, as ever, a superb evening. The staff are excellent, attentive without being obtrusive, wonderful service. I had the Agnolotti con vitello arrosto as my main course which I enjoyed tremendously, my husband had the calves liver which is consistently top notch, hopefully it won't be too long before our next trip to London and and our next visit to this oustanding restaurant.
4	After a day in Hyde Park, this was a gem to find a short walk away. Delicious Turkish food...the lamb was tender and succulent, the chicken moist, perfect hummus, delicious aubergine, authentic Turkish coffee and the Turkish delight was a hit, too (I'm typically not a fan). Much to my and my husband's delight, the kids loved it too, and ate heartily. I've had better baklava...it wasn't dripping with butter and honey like some I've had, but over all the meal and the service were excellent.
4	Evereything was absolutely fantastic! The food, the staff and the environment. This was my first time at a keralan restaurant and I am definately going back again when I go to London.
4	 My husband and I visit Bournes at least twice a week.It is a well appointed very friendly place with a very pleasant staff. I also use Bournes as a meeting place to chat with friends. Thanks to Julie they serve the best hottest coffee for miles and she is always welcoming and extremely friendly. The homemade cakes are to die for and the food is well prepared and locally sourced .I would also like to praise Sheila, Coltette and another long standing member of the staff (whose name I don't know..but she has a little boy called Charlie!!). These people,together with Julie, work hard to make you feel so welcome and will go out of their way to help in any way they can. Keep up the good work everyone..and good luck to the new manager. We hope that Bournes will continue to provide this excellent service. I recommend the restaurant to everyone who attends my talks on Denby Pottery. 
4	After moving into the area just over a year ago we were very disappointed to see our local pub in such a state. The new owners have renovated the bulls neck to the highest of standards with some of the nicest food in the area to match it. Everyone was very friendly and we will most certainly come back again soon!  This restaurant definitely stands out above the other restaurants in the area and I would recommend it 100%.
4	 Just returned home from Akbars Rotherham, probably our 10th visit. As we live towards Holmesfield it is quite a trip for us but every mile is worth it for the quality food, ambience and excellent staff. Tonight we were served by Zaf and the reason for my posting is to say what an attentive and excellent waiter he is - his manner, friendliness and 'checking back' on food drinks etc really put the icing on the cake for our party. After working in hotels and restaurants for over ten years staff can make or break an occasion and I can only heap praise on the staff of Akbars, especially Zaf - he made our evening perfect and I hope he reaches the potential he is capable of... Perhaps even front of house - its always nice to be smiled at when you walk in the door no matter HOW busy you are! Thanks again Zaf for making our evening. 
4	 I have never had anything but an excellant experience at this restaurant. We were a large party but still received prompt polite service. Steaks were cooked to perfection and portions were generous. The table was ours for the night and we never felt rushed. And they must have the cleanest toilets I have ever used. Highly recommended. 
4	 Wow, food was amazing!!! No complaints whatsoever. Wine was lovely, service brilliant. Saturday's evening meal was perfect and possibly the best I have had in Cambridge. Definitely coming back for a special occasion... 
4	 We went to Thai Erawan using an online voucher which made the food great value. I was a little worried after reading other reviews, however when we arrived we were greeted and the atmosphere inside was lovely. I ordered the seaweed roles after reading a positive review on tripadvisor, they were delicious. We ordered 2 mains and coconut rice which we'd never tried before. The starters and mains were really tasty and full of flavour. The service was just right for us, we weren't rushed through but it wasn't as slow as other people had suggested it might be. Overall it was lovely food and a lovely atmosphere and we'd definitely go back. 
4	 Lovely pub, quick service for food :) reasonably priced as well :) Would definitely go back if ever in the area again  
4	 Came here for a birthday lunch with family friends and my partner, food was fabulous and wine to go with each course was lovely. La Trompette never lets me down the food is always delicious from starter to dessert and even the bread and butter is great!! Service is always good here and you definately get what you pay for. I will always come back to this restuarant for special occassions 
4	 On one occassion in many years I have been displeased with the takeaway and that's only because a gentleman recently forgot to bag my sausage!!! The food is excellent. Their restaurant is tasty too!!! I am glad they have a restaurant. It's great, go! 
4	 Situated just around the corner from Covent Garden market in Henrietta Street, Bella Italia is one of a chain of Italian Restaurants. Very small but cozy, staff are extremely helpful and efficient. Dinner service is probably better than lunch service although that is true for many places. Food is authentic and delicious as well as being reasonably priced. It cost the two of us £32 for mains, desserts, drinks and tip so not too bad. There is a nice atmosphere where you don't feel as if you are being rushed at all, but food does still come out quickly. If given the option choose to sit in the corner by the window or downstairs otherwise you have to choose who sits with their back to the open door. In the summer you can sit outside although at the moment this isn't available due to maintenance works on the building next door. 
4	 This is my second visit to MPW. The menu has improved since the restaurant first opened I Absolutely love the food and service.  Would definitely recommend!!  Cannot fault the food or service at all!! 
4	 Yesterday I went to Carluccio's with a couple of friends to have some lunch and although it was quite busy the manager managed to find us a table relatively quickly. The food was delicious and the staff was nice. The waitress that served us was very kind and friendly and did a very good job even though the place was very busy. Definitely will go there again. 
4	 Fantastic food and service. The atmosphere it is perfect as we feel you can relax and enjoy the food with good company. 
4	 My husband and I ate at this lovely restaurant on Sunday. Food was amazing, service brilliant and complimentary poppadoms and drink topped the evening off. Have now booked for a xmas meal with friends. 
4	 I visited this restaurant today and i must say what an amazing experience we had, myself and 5 friends were all looking for something different and thats exactly what we got, the food was absolutely gorgeous, the waiting on staff could not do enough for us one in particular called joanne who was lovely, you could not fault any part of it, we even asked if we could thank the chef who was called sherez, who came out and met us and was very friendly. I would fully recommend the jalfrezi as i have never tasted anythink like it, So if your looking for excellant service and mouth watering indian food this is by far the best indian in town, infact we have booked to go back at the weekend.all i can say is thank you to everyone at sultan's palace, definately recommend you try it. 
4	My partner and i decided to go to Reds after i finished work on Friday night (5:30) so expected a wait. Left our name and number with the staff at the door and was told it would be just over an hour. This wasn't a problem as we went and shopped around Trinity to pass the time. Only 45 minutes passed before we received a call to say our table was ready!  I ordered the pulled pork and slaw and my partner ordered the beef brisket with corn bread and onion rings. The food only took about 5 minutes before it was in front of us and it was amazing! i loved everything about it.  I would of liked to try a starter/desert but i'm not a massive eater so didn't want to over face myself! Maybe next time....  The price was very reasonable for what we ordered (the meals and 2 sprites) as it came to just over £25. We will defo be visiting again and have recommended Red's to everyone!
4	I've been to Bravi on and off quite frequently, but haven't been in South Shields since new year so just fancied a quick lunch with my other half. The special lunch menu is great - lovely choice of starters and main dishes, and at a price that doesn't break the bank. The service is fast, friendly and the atmosphere perfect for a midday meet up. Love Bravi in the evening too. So much for the diet...
4	Always want to go here, never had a bad experience and i have been many times now. Fantastic service and the food is delicious. Family business now has a tradition to go here for their Christmas meal and even all those Labouring lads love it. Cannot fault it.
4	 Tried El Lomito in Northwood after searching the web for something different in the area. It was Saturday night and the restaurant was busy but buzzing in a good way. Nice bar area downstairs where the guys serving the cocktails were friendly and helpful. Upstairs in the restaurant we ended up next to a table of four who were heading for a very good night. It was a shame that their exuberance overshadowed what was otherwise a suitably lively atmosphere.  The menu was impressive, but its really all about the steak. Between us we had a very chunky piece of fillet and a delicious slice of rib eye. Both cooked perfectly rare. Chunky chips and nice sauces to boot. We also had the garlic and lemon and spinach, which was really good. When we finished we left our noisy neighbours behind and headed back down to the bar for coffee. The atmosphere was lovely as we chilled out on the sofas tucked under the stairs.  It's not cheap, but it's worth paying a little bit more for very tasty steak, great sides and something different when compared to the chain restaurants that dominate the area. Last but not least the staff were great. There were plenty of them and everyone seemed keen to ensure the customers had a good time. We will be back to this little slice of Argentina. 
4	 Literally just got back and had to write a review straight away as I am so pleased!   Visiting Clitheroe for the day we wanted to find somewhere to eat, and saw this on Tripadvisor. As it was on Pendle Hill we thought it sounded interesting and went to give it a go.  SO glad we did! About 10 minutes out of Clitheroe centre by car. We were greeted as soon as we arrived and sat at a table next to a window looking round out onto the valley and the hills. It wasn't very busy, and the setting was just perfect - looking over the hills and lights hung from branches in the restaurant itself!  The food was delicious - we had 3 courses and were absolutely stuffed! We went on a day that had a 2 for 1 offer, but I would definitely be willing to pay the normal price for the quality of food, and the service that we received. The staff were incredible, one man came round to have a chat with us whilst we were waiting for desert, the waitress couldn't have been friendlier and when we went to pay we got chatting to the staff at the bar too!  Very impressed with The Wellsprings, I would definitely recommend it and will be visiting again in the near future! Sit by the window if you go - it's a lovely view! 
4	 Not only is this my favorite bar in Brighton to drink it is now also my favorite place to eat! Great menu at great prices. Very relaxed atmosphere during the day which also turns into great nightlife! Staff are constantly friendly and very welcoming! Would recommend to everyone!! :) 
4	We would like to thank the team at Jocasta's for their exceptional service at our Work Christmas Party. They made sure that we enjoyed our time whilst amongst a large party from another organisation. The food was delicious with an excellent chef. We highly recommend booking your event with them.   One of our Director's Neil said &quot;The care and attention to detail was really impressive - this is where your next event should be.&quot;  Thanks again from everyone at Page Nelson Solicitors!
4	 This restaurant had everything, amazing view of the beach, great service, wonderful atmosphere and perfect seafood. It was a great place to take a colleague and the noise levels were kept to a minumum so we could actually talk as well as relax. The service was wonderful and all the waiting staff were charming.   Check out the specials as apparently they change frequently. I had bream which was cooked to perfection. It was very very expensive though so it's the kind of place you'd only go for a treat or a one off. I thought the wine was a little overpriced but was happy to pay for the gorgeous food itself. 
4	I was invited to a friends birthday and it was the first time I'd been here. Much more fancy place than we'd usually go and it was amazing. The food was so good my dessert was all melty choccy heaven and I will want to go back, maybe my birthday. We got served quickly and everyone liked what they ordered which must be a first!! Glad I wasn't paying the bill.
4	 We visited this pub for lunch during a day trip to Derbyshire because it had received such positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We were not disappointed and would thoroughly recommend the pub to anyone travelling in the area.  The pub was beautifully decorated for Christmas and presented a welcoming atmosphere as soon as you opened the door. The menu was extensive, offering perhaps too many choices! The food was very well presented and portions were generous. Prices were very reasonable and the service was excellent. It was a delight to discover this pub and we only wish it was a little nearer to our home town!  
4	 We were down in Goodleigh for a few days and we ate here twice. Amazing food that was so delicious and we had a very warm welcome from the landlords. Owners were very hospitable and couldn't do enough for their customers (even cooking to order if you really fancy something not normally on the menu).   Never been made so welcome in a local village pub. Thank you. 
4	 Came to Windsor and stumbled across this resturant, couldn't have been happier. Great choice of authentic Italian dishes and drinks. Topped off with a fantastic service from all the family including tips on where to visit in Italy. Thanks so much and see you all again soon 
4	 Had really nice working lunch there and must compliment the service received by waitress Zuzana who was exceptionally helpful, very friendly and really looked after me. The service before wasn't that great so this was really nice to experience for change.   Also i must say the food was to die for. Had the curry that tasted heavenly well done to chefs. Great presentation too! 
4	Great views of the river, beautiful inside with plants, statues and carved wooden tables and most importantly delicious food! Good for vegetarians.
4	 It was my first but definitely not last time in this Buonissimo. I went for a vegetarian option which was well-balanced, juicy and incredibly tasty. The homely atmosphere added some extra charm to our dinner. Staff were attentive and friendly also Matteo gregarious owner, walked up to us to explain some details about food. If you look for gorgeous Italian place in Birmingham stop here you certainly will not regret! Thanks Buonissimo :-) 
4	We dined at the Garden Rooms August bank holiday to celebrate my father in laws 90th Birthday. There were 11 of us and we all had the Sunday lunch menu. Firstly, I cannot praise all of the staff highly enough. The staff were advised in advance that it was a 'big' birthday but really pulled out the stops with a birthday banner and a card and chocolates at his place setting. They also sang happy birthday and delivered my father in laws dessert with candles. Every course was excellent but for me the highlight was the main course of roast beef. It was possibly the most tender and nicest piece of beef that I have ever eaten in a restaurant. My fellow beef eaters all agreed. Other main courses of fish and chicken were equally praised.  Starters and desserts were also highly praised. The Garden Rooms' are an absolute delight and I would recommend them to anyone.
4	 First time in Brighton and found this restaurant purely by chance. Didn't realize it was vegetarian until we got inside which delighted me even more! I'm not total veggie but it is my preferred food. I'm a nutritional therapist and run workshops on healthy eating so am known for my critical appraisal of food and my creative recipes. The staff were lovely, knowledgeable and the food divine. We shared the mezze (between 4) very generous and loved it. We chose 4 different mains to so we could try a greater variety. Every single mouthful was a flavour explosion and my carnivore friends were just as appreciative. Unfortunately no time for pudding but thank you for a most enjoyable meal and a window seat for brilliant people watching.  Maggie Franks (delicious-nutritious.co.uk) 
4	 Superb food, great service!! We come time and time again and always get treated so well, its our favourite restaurant by far!!! Fantastic!! 
4	I hadn't been to spode for many years and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal.  The customer service was outstanding and we were made to feel very welcome.  Many thanks to Ray who not only told me how to get the hole in onion rings but he went the extra mile and demonstrated :-)
4	 I really enjoyed my trip to the tea rooms, I am a previous customer and i enjoy my visit every time i come. The food is brilliant, I am particularly fond of the meringue dessert and the chocolate coated flapjack as I have sweet tooth! The service by the gentlemen was top notch! I felt very welcomed and was always tendered to. I will be returning again for some more top nosh! 
4	 Henrys Bar is lovely place to unwind in the evening. The music played is enjoyable and unobtrusive. It has the feel of an American Style bar. The staff are always friendly. The meals are always well cooked. 
4	 what can I say but excellent myself and my husband used a group-on voucher we were greeted by a large smile and a very friendly welcome atmosphere was very nice and restaurant very clean we started with the king prawn they were very large and the flavors just explored in your month my husband upgraded to the 16oz fillet and I had the rib eye my husband he has his steak blue and it's very rare for restaurants get it right first time but it was no problem for this chef right first time and both steaks just melted in your month and were packed with flavor the potions are just about right but we passed on dessert as were full after 2 courses even if you don,t have a voucher it,s worth ever penny and we will be going back the staff were excellent there when you needed them but not hovering we got first class service I would say a ideal place for couples friends older family's and group's not really for young children or baby,s would advise that you book in advance was booked in the name of Brown 
4	 I decided to go for lunch with my grandparents on a visit back to Dorset and as my grandfather is restricted to a wheelchair decided to reserve a table just to ensure easy access. When we arrived however we discovered that the wheelchair lift had stopped working that morning and my grandmother went in to cancel the table as we couldn't get into the restaurant. However, a waiter and chef came outside and lifted the wheelchair up a flight of stairs and into the restaurant. If that wasn't enough the staff moved tables, provided wine in a water glass for my grandfather and were extremely attentive, helpful and friendly. We didn't feel like we were in the way (although we were completely obstructing the till area for about 5 minutes!) or a burden in anyway. The food was also excellent, hot and arrived quickly. I was extremely impressed and will definitely visit again. Thank you very much to Fernando (the best waiter in the world!) for making our lunch so excellent. 
4	 Fresh Basil is a regular port of call for us...We've tried all the others and always come back here. The staff are always friendly and helpful,the Deli counter staff all have great knowledge about the cheeses and meats and are happy to let you try anything you're not sure about. The food is always of a high standard (they don't skimp on portion sizes either!) and most importantly they source a lot of it from local suppliers which to me is a huge bonus...we have so many excellent food suppliers in the area, and Fresh Basil use this to their advantage. Try some of the fabulous artisan breads always on display in the window...you won't be disappointed! The selection of cheeses is huge...from the infamous &quot;Stinking Bishop&quot; to locally made white cheese, along with carefully selected cheeses from around the world... the French Brie is to die for... The cafe boasts an impressive menu whether you're having breakfast or lunch (the seafood platter is amazing - and big enough to share!) and in addition to this they will tailor any of the platters they do to include anything you want from the deli...you really couldn't ask for more... if you're a foodie, this place needs to be on your radar!  All in all, this is a fantastic little cafe/deli which is a must to try if you're visiting Belper. 
4	 Love this traditional local pub with its friendly welcoming atmosphere. The food is of excellent homemade quality with generous portions. The prices (drinks and food) are very reasonable. Very clean throughout. Highly recommended. 
4	 My friend and I had a lovely lunch. Be prepared to wait a while as all food is cooked to order but it is really worth the wait as lunch was absolutely delicious. My friend had the chicken pie and I had the curry followed by the most enjoyable pannacotta with strawberry compote and a homemade shortbread biscuit. The waitresses were very pleasant and always smiling! We always book in advance to ensure that we do not have to wait for a table as they seem to get very busy understandable with the high quality of the food. 
4	 I have visited Roo's on previous occasions and have always enjoyed it, but last week was the best. I took my two children (one a bouncy 6 year old boy!) out for a teatime treat and all I can say is a massive thank you! The service was amazing, the food was gorgeous and our host (Dave?) was attentive and couldn't do enough for us, even going as far as providing my son with a plate of Nachos a, while he waited for his meal as my daughter and I had starters and he didn't! We opted for the 3 course meal for £18, and I ordered the steak, which was cooked exactly as I asked for it, to absolute perfection. I was able to spend quality time with my children, in a very relaxed setting, and I cannot thank our host enough for making the evening a very enjoyable one. 
4	 I've been visiting Dame Tartine pretty much since it opened and I have been back here a number of times for breakfast, brunch and lunch. All of my visits have either been with my wife and 2 children or just for a lunch with my wife. I have to say I have never had a bad meal in the past 2 years and really you can't ask for much more than that from any small, local restaurant. Some dishes have been better than others but that is to be expected as the chef is only human. Prices are very reasonable and the service has been consistent whilst being friendly. Unfortunately I’ve we’ve never been able to go in the evening but it is on the must do list (with the 50% off during the week it’s an amazing bargain!).  Last week I enjoyed a chicken salad with aubergine plus the soup of the day and my wife had the pate with the dishes being flavoursome and filling. I’ve enjoyed steak, soups, pastries, breakfast fare in the past and all good. Unfortunately a number of times I've visited, left full and missed out on the fantastic looking desserts! I say to myself every time 'I must leave room' but I enjoy the main meal too much!!!  Something to remember as well - they do good coffee with a better atmosphere than Costa's, Nero's or Pret which are on the main street. 
4	We visited the restaurant a few weeks ago but the service was so good that I just had to pass it on. Our waiter, Joseph, was very helpful, he explained the menu to us and really went out of his way to make our evening just wonderful! One of my friends had a nut allergy and he guided her through which dishes to order using a seperate allergen chart.  It was a fantastic night out! Food was good too but the cocktails, two for one happy hour and service is what we'll definitely be coming back for!
4	 I have been to Summat to Ate a few times now and I love it! The restaurant is lovely and clean. Decor is great and the food is delicious. I love the hot rock experience and can't bring myself to have anything else! The starters are perfect and the deserts are divine! Staff are attentive yet not intrusive. My only complaint is the location. This restaurant would be jam packed if it were more central to Wigan town centre or (and I hate to say this) in a more affluent area. However we travel to dine here and we will continue to do so. Thank you! 
4	 We are never disappointed with the food at The Inn and this time was no exception. The staff (Tom and Vicky) are always super friendly and full of character. Gerry, the landlord is welcoming and friendly but also a connoisseur of all things food and wine. The wine and whisky range is vast and quite special. We had the rare opportunity to sample some up and coming new cocktails which are still a working progress but was so much fun to critique. Will no doubt be returning soon. 
4	 A lovely small friendly Thai Restaurant with parking close by. A good choice of well cooked food, which arrived quickly. You need to bring your own alcohol until a licence is granted but otherwise there is a good choice of soft drinks and fruit cocktails. It is very reasonably priced and we will definitely go back. 
4	 My friends and I were walking passed Per Tutti and the smell wafting out of the door was mouthwatering so we decided that we would go there after we had finished shopping. When we came back it was 6 o'clock ish and have to admit we did have second thoughts as we felt a little under dressed as we were greeted by stunningly dress maitre d. As soon as we spoke to her we instantly felt at ease and were shown to our table by our waiter. For starter, we all had bruchetta which was lovely although I struggled to eat it with out all the toppings falling off! I would say there was a little too much olive oil on it as i was wiping it off my hands for sometime afterwards. For main I had lasagne which was the best i'd ever tasted! I was getting full towards the end but i just could not leave any! My friend had a barbecue chicken pizza which i tried and was really nice and was served with really good quality mozzerella. My other friend had a chicken pasta dish which she wouldn't share so it must have been good! We were in a rush to get home which was a shame as i would have loved to stay a little longer as the atmosphere was really good. I will definitely be going again and i'm so glad i have discovered this little gem - i can't believe i never knew it was there! 
4	 Bright,clean well presented restaurant.All staff very polite and the friendly service is superb.Food is excellent. 
4	 We came here for Sunday lunch with my parents, husband and two young children back in November 2014 (23rd). I was a little hesitant having read some of the reviews but we had an excellent time with really lovely food (it’s worth pointing out that the brasserie downstairs and the restaurant upstairs operate separately, but the reviews here cover both areas) - we were in the upstairs restaurant.   We arrived at 12pm, the first ones there and had a lovely table with views overlooking the seafront, and plenty of space between the tables.   I chose Sunday roast with all the trimmings, followed by sticky toffee pudding. Food was lovely - you can have more potatoes/vegetables if you want to, and we did have an extra bowlful, so there was no chance of us leaving hungry! The veg was a nice mix of roasted root veg, the second bowl a little over-salted but otherwise very nice. I thought it was excellent value at £16.50 for two courses or £20.50 for 3 courses.   Service was perfectly good and friendly, we did have trouble getting attention to pay the bill but it wasn’t a problem. Overall my parents loved the meal, and we will be coming back. 
4	 Been to this place on many occasions and everything is always top notch from food to service not got a bad meal there ever, going again tonight 
4	 Went for a meal here and was pleasantly surprised. Food was really nice and staff very friendly. The menu is not extensive but it's a pub that serves typical pub food, we could find nothing to complain about 
4	 I have not felt so welcome in a restaurant for a very long time - the staff here are absolute stars. They were really sweet to our toddler, filling up his tommy tippee with milk and chatting to him.  The food was lovely, and I would personnally recommend the steak and guiness pie. 
-4	 Really great food, well prepared and served which needs to have a dog friendly sign in large letters on the outside of the entrance. I have no problem with dogs in the garden but I object strongly to having to eat with the flee ridden things sharing a table with me while I eat.  
-4	 My first visit to the Red lion was a few years ago, and I was impressed with the service and great quality food. However, the last few visits to The Red Lion have left me very disappointed.   My most recent visit will certainly my last, with poor service and terrible food. The pie was inedible and even worse there was no one to tell! We had to wait 30 minutes for someone to come over and take the plates. It was at this point the waiter said would we like any desserts! After not even touching any of our meals.   It seemed as if he was in a rush, and behold on our way out he was in his own clothes enjoying a beverage with what looked like other staff members. Very disappointed as I once held this restaurant in such a high regard. 
-4	 What can I say. Waited 15 mins in queue to place order. then waited 40 mins for food.   Turned up cold Burger with two pieces lettice. Chips not cooked and cold. Complete waste of money. Sent stinker email to Greenking. You can guess no reply £40 spent on four.  Will never ever return. Crap food for your money. Better at the Globe.!! And thats saying something. 
-4	We had a friendly and helpful waitress, however the food was of a very low quality. I had the Saltimbocca Chicken which was very dry. The vegetables looked and tasted like microwaved leftovers. We had to give the onion rings back. I am not a fussy eater, so to leave anything behind is rare for me.
-4	Me and my girlfriend went out for food this Saturday and were very disappointed by the food and the incredibly rude and dismissive staff.  When, at the end of the meal the waiter finally asked how everything was, and we replied it wasn't great, he simply shrugged. It was our first time here, and I can't say we're too keen on returning.
-4	 Visited the Greaves Park Hotel for the first time in a few years to find it'd changed hands and is now marketed at customers with large wallets and small appetites.  The menu is ridiculously over-priced for what it is and the food was pretty abysmal. Salad was brown and obviously past its sell-by date and portions were generally too small.   The service wasn't too slow although that could be explained by the fact there were only about two other couples in the rest of the restaurant. The staff were helpful but tended to be abrupt and weren't easy to talk to.  There would have to be an awful lot of changes if I were to revisit any time soon. 
-4	Popped in a short while ago with friends, we often do, being very local and very regular. Today there was ten of us and we had with us, our cocker spaniel, also a frequent visitor to the pub. He's with us for drinks and he's with us when we order food, one of the family.  So I was very disappointed when I was told upon arrival that we couldn't have the dog on the carpeted area, this being most of the bar. So our daughter returned home with our dog, who incidentally is a highly trained and extremely obedient gun dog.  Imagine our disgust when not five minutes later a party was shown to their table with a dog. Seated at their table on the carpeted area.  What's going on White Horse? One rule for the regulars that have spent many hundreds of pounds with you, held functions and parties there and one rule for the others?  Shame really, we've put up with the increasing prices and diminishing service, poor quality frozen re-heats and the reductions in portion sizes.  But this, for us was the final straw, the friendship of Derek and some staff can now no longer outweigh all the failings.  Thanks and goodbye.
-4	 I visited the Cunning Man with 6 members of my family to celebrate my daughter's birthday. She booked a table for 5.30 pm as we had 2 young grandsons with us and did not leave the restaurant until after 8.00 pm! Far too long for a 2 course meal with 1 round of drinks. Twice our son-in-law had to take his 4 year old for a walk as he was getting restless. We were kept waiting when we arrived before being shown to our table, we had to wait to place our drinks order which then took some time to arrive. We were then approached by a waiter who said he was looking after us, we placed our food order and then informed there would be a 30 minute wait, this was probably more like 40 minutes. The food to be fair was not too bad although the vegetables could have been warmer. The waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu but in such a way that he did not really want us to, we had already decided that we would forego a starter in favour of a dessert so we did order. It probably took another 30 minutes for our desserts to arrive and when they did the custard on 3 of them was cold with a thick skin on top. The staff did not appear to be enjoying their work and some were quite rude. The manager was going around in a panic trying to pacify what appeared to be quite a few disgruntled customers. I actually overheard him say to one couple as he sat them down not to judge the Cunning Man on tonight as there was a new menu which meant everything had to be cooked from fresh and they were struggling to keep up. I can only judge from my experience on the night and will not be returning. By the time we left people were leaving due to the number of items unavailable. To top everything off the waiter tried to overcharge me on my debit card, when I pointed out that the amount was different to that shown on the bill he apologised and said he must have input the wrong number. 
-4	 We arrived around 4pm, pub was relatively quiet and initial service pleasant and efficient. We ordered two beef and one chicken roast dinners plus one risotto. (which I have to say was ok)   Food was served within a reasonable time, however the beef on both dinners was really tough, chicken was edible but the accompanying roast potatoes on all the plates were overcooked, mash was lumpy and vegetables tasteless. We were just about to complain about the beef when one of the staff came over to ask if everything was fine. He was informed about the beef to which he said he would go and speak to the chef. We assume he did but never came back to report anything to us. By this time our three roast dinners were somewhat cold and very unappetising and most of the food was left on the plates and when the waitress came to clear she asked if we were satisfied. Same story NO beef tough and inedible, will tell chef, no feedback from her.   We decided not to have a sweet or any further drinks. At the counter we asked for the bill and whether there would be any reduction for the poor quality of the beef. The member of staff who took the first complaint was called and a discussion followed, again I will ask the chef, the answer was no, chef had said that the beef was perfectly edible. We paid the bill, left our email address and phone number asked that the manager call us to register our complaint and left very unhappy.  Tuesday 29th November I received a call from a person stating to be the manager. I explained what had happened following which the person said that she would need to investigate with the staff members concerned and that she would call me back the following day. I AM STILL AWAITING THAT CALL.   Sadly we did not check trip advisor prior to going to the Cross Keys if we had we probable would not have gone. It is difficult to judge reviews as everyone can have differing expectations of food quality, I would have to say having experienced the poor quality of food, lack of customer service, and a manager who cannot manage a chef who seemingly is incapable of delivering basic dishes warm and edible that TERRIBLE is the only review I can give this establishment. You have been warned !!! 
-4	Fantastic location, good premises, this should be the best pub in the area. Visited recently after long absence and unfortunately it is being let down by bad or non existent management, bar staff try hard enough but are slow and can't remember who's turn is next, food orders taken but long waits, real ale all tasted like brown bath water , it looked like every glass and plate used that day was still on the tables with food & mess everywhere. Things not helped by agressive and offensive punters by the door scaring off normal folks. One day someone will turn this place round and make a fortune but don't hold yer breath
-4	I work just around the corner from here and have been ordering since it opened but now??????? Most of the staff have changed and the new people are rude and ill mannered. (saw a customer being shouted at when I was in last). This place was the talk of the town when it first opened but for about 3 months now it's been declining. For a business to 100% alter the way things are done then watch it crumble (which it seems to a lot of us) is a real sad state of affairs. Was this place just a 'try out' because it's difficult to understand how the food, taste, portions, price, staff have all changed for the worse??? Where have all the beautiful salads gone and the 'homemade' spring rolls?? Was great while it lasted but no more.
-4	 Went here for some food after the pictures and how sorry we were  Greeted by staff who just didn't want to be there at all  We waited about 40 minutes for food that when it came I wish they had turned the dial on the microwave down just one notch.  I could see the &quot;chef&quot; in the kitchen ripping open the packets of the food to serve up to people  Tasted awful  Only saving grace was that I found a voucher online whilst sitting WAITING for my food which knocked 2/3 off the bill !! 
-4	Worst ever experience of a table table Oh wait hold on its not a table table anymore but they accept the card to give you rewards but you cant use your vouchers - confused you will be  Waited 15 minutes for a table and a drink at the bar, only then be moved to another table as they were cramming everybody into one area together to then wait to order  Order was taken by a miserable waitress who looked really fed up carrying massive heavy trays around  Whatever were you thinking Whitbread - chalk boards and expensive menus are not want we are used to as regulars of table table  The food was dire, stodgy the only thing good about it was the temperature it was served hot However it came out far too quickly - 10 minutes after ordering even though the restaurant had a lot of diners at the time - no something has gone terribly wrong here Will definitely not return
-4	From the claims made for it on its website I was expecting a good dining experience at Brasserie 103 but came away really disappointed. The place lacks the sophistication claimed for it, it noisy to the extent that conversation is nigh impossible and the service is desperately poor. We waited 45 minutes for the starters and another 50 minutes for the main courses and the serving staff showed no interest in us or as to whether we enjoyed our meal or apologised for the delays. The food is dreadfully mediocre and in no way matches the claims the Brasserie makes for itself and the prices are way out of line with the quality of the ingredients or the cooking. £16.90 for a very poor, dry, Chicken Katsu Curry was pretty disgraceful.
-4	 Went here with a group of friends on our lunch break with limited time the service was very slow and we had to try get someone's attention more than once for the bill. The menu is very limited the salads that we ordered we very very plain as was the fish pie tasteless and bland! If your after lunch I would to any of the other great places in soho. 
-4	 Came for a bacon sandwich, but only sausage available, even though Norden Village website states you do all day breakfast. Ordered 2 sausage butties and 2 cans of Coca-Cola and was charged £10.90 !! Cans were £1.50 and butties were £3.95. I was expecting some very good quality butchers sausage, but what turned up were low meat content, very low quality sausages. sliced lengthways and then each slice cut into 3 pieces on each half of the teacake. Having left most of the sandwich due to the poor quality sausage I decided to have an ice cream and spotted the sausages in the warming area of the range and the large ones were the princely sum of £1. What a rip off price we were charged, at least Dick Turpin wore a mask. 
-4	 The only positive aspect of L'anima are design and architecture. Unfortunately inside the restaurant is very cold, I had to wear my scarf during the dinner. Average service, bad quality food extremely salty.  Absolutely to avoid. 
-4	 First time we've eaten here and was sadly disappointed. Nice location sat outside enjoying the rare sunshine. I ordered the calamari to start with a mushroom risotto as a main and my wife a straightforward spicy pizza. Unfortunately my calamari basically tasted of flour and the risotto was undercooked to the point I couldn't eat it after few mouthfuls. They took it back and offered a different choice but we decided to instead share the pizza. This turned out to be very doughy and lacking in flavour. They took the risotto off the bill which was fair enough but personally I rather pay and eat decent food. Not sure we'll try the place again. 
-4	 barman served queue jumper before others, starters wrong, mains wrong with items missing and the quality of the chicken breasts akin to eating cardboard, steak asked for medium and came cremated (they did replace this without asking) but the waitress when serving out mains had another plate with 2 sausages (obviously for another dissatisfied customer) but dropped one down my sons £50 rugby shirt without even noticing it had fell off her plate! big grease stain down the back. Manager offered us free desserts but we just wanted to leave.... dont visit if busy! 
-4	 really not for the faint hearted. The food is dreadful and the kitchen looks suspect. There must be more e factors in their sauces plus sugar and salt that are really, really bad for you. Shame the village needs a good chinese! 
-4	 First impression was a warm welcoming entrance, staff were warm and friendly. The cost of the Sunday roast was £13.95 for one course,which in my opinion is quite expensive for a pub lunched had 1 drink each consisting of 2 beers and 2 jack Daniels & coke. We finished our meal with 4 Irish coffee's. The food was ok but certainly not worth £13.95 a head, but the biggest shock was £24 for the Irish Coffee's which were lukewarm, The overall cost for this meal was £94.10 That's with no starter or dessert, would we go back...that's a big no, There are no houses nearby so this pub has to rely on passing trade, so my advice would be to pass by this pub and go to the Victoria in west street Dunstable or the farmers boy in kensworth, Both lovely pubs with good food a real ale 
-4	 Me and my girlfriend have been here twice. Our first time was really nice with delicious food and we advised people to check it out. My last visit sadly left me visiting the hospital with a severe case of food poisoning. The food did not taste quite as good as the first time and the waitresses were just wandering around like head-less chickens. After having our starters taken away we was asked if we would like desserts! I don't know what they are doing wrong but suggest staying away until it is sorted 
-4	 We've been to this pub a few times, its in a lovely location. The service is pretty hit and miss, sometimes good, sometimes pretty painful. We went there last weekend (saturday) with friends for lunch, there were 6 of us in total. 3 of us had the burger and within 48 hours, the 3 of us all came down with severe food poisoning - the worst any of us have ever experienced. We were all out of action for at least 2 days. We contacted the pub to let them know, whilst they said they took this seriously, yet at the same time failed to offer any kind of apology. They promised to follow up and call us back but a week later, still no one has bothered to get in contact which we are appalled about given the severity of the situation. Don't eat here! 
-4	 Frozen chips and straight out of the freezer fish . Coke drinks were flat as we're their replacements £6 service charge is a joke , do not go there 
-4	 this was a gastropub which featured on our dining out circuit and we last visited a couple of years ago. how things have changed. it did not help that our route to and from the bar was blocked by a group of painters and decorators just in from work nor that doombar had usurped the adnams formerly available. we were presented with a very short menu from which the most appetizing main course appeared to be haddock and chips, until my enquiries established that the chips were frozen. we would have been the only people in the dining room if it were not for various drinkers using it as a short cut between car park and bar ,so far as i could see from the 50% or so of the light fittings which were working. we were told that the place is about to close for a wash and brush up and menu change. this may make a difference but frankly we will not be back to check. 
-4	 My girlfriend and I wanted to eat early before a cinema trip on February 28th. We couldn't get in to a couple of our preferred restaurants and the reviews for the Olive Grove looked OK and as we had never eaten there we thought we would try it. Big mistake. There were certainly plenty of serving staff and we promptly ordered the Antipasti to share as a starter and then I had Linguine with chicken and saffron and my girlfriend ordered Risotto with Asparagus.The main ingredient of the starter was two slices of cold ham! Accompanied by a little Rocket, a few pieces of salami and some very soggy, salty olives. The presentation was terrible and all the ingredients tasted like they were the cheapest that the restaurant could possibly find. Worse was to come. My Linguine was rubbery, the saffron sauce was powdery and the chicken pieces were tasteless and again - seemed like the cheapest chicken they could possibly have sourced. I was hungry so i eat about 1/4 of it before I pushed it away. My girlfriend's Risotto had rice which was undercooked and had a powdery texture (perhaps the remnants of a dry sauce mix?) a strong garlic flavour masked any flavours of asparagus or other ingredients. She ate 1/3 of it before giving up. We just left as quickly as we could but I now regret not speaking to the manager before we left to tell him how appalling the food was. We will never return. As someone who lives in Canterbury I am embarrassed to think that visitors to our lovely City will be served such terrible food if they are not forewarned of this restaurant. 
-4	 We passed The Blacksteer a few times before we saw the sign flapping in the wind, it's confusing because the main sign says Eastfield Inn. The restaurant was nicely laid out, and the service was ok. As it was a steak house I thought the burgers would be good, so I had a Deluxe burger. It was very fatty and greasy, couldn't finish it. The chips were tepid and tasted like they had been waiting around for a while. My girlfriend had the cheese burger which was as fatty, I think the secret sauce is Heinz. We didn't bother with dessert and won’t be going back for seconds! 
-4	 This place must have a reputation for poor service... As we were looking at the menu outside, a local lady came over and mentioned to us not to bother. Slightly bemused by this we continued upstairs, thinking we would give it a go. Mostly because this was the only place with empty seats in busy Padstow... We now know why!   We were &quot;greeted&quot; by a very hostile, unfriendly waitress, who questioned us relentlessly on what we were planning to order, bizarre as we hadn't even sat down to look at a menu properly! (Maybe she wanted to work out how much we were planning on spending?) We said that we wanted some lunch, and maybe some hot drinks (as it was a particularly rainy day) to which she made a very obvious eye-roll. She then told us &quot;Well, you can sit at the bar, but it's not very nice&quot;. The ENTIRE place was empty! Maybe they had a large booking in (we don't know as no reason was given as to why this was our only option) but the tables were not laid out as such and even so there was plenty of room. It wasn't even peak time! We reluctantly agreed, knowing this was really the only option as everywhere else was so busy. We even politely suggested that we would be happy to just have drinks if they were due to be busy.   Then to our amazement, as we stepped forward to take our seats, she stood in front of us, blocking the way, and said &quot;If you want hot drinks then go somewhere else&quot; We looked at each other in total disbelief, and decided to leave.   We have never experienced anything like it! It's like they don't want customers!!   The staff need some serious training in customer service! Rude beyond belief!  Ps. Dear management, we would be great full for a response/apology as to why we were treated so appallingly, rather than requesting our review gets deleted! (We have seen many other similar reviews disappear !) which is therefore giving a false representation! 
-4	Overpriced poor quality cocktails.   Loooong wait, POOR service and EVEN poorer attitude. Will not be back. That's for sure.
-4	 Bless them, they try, but this place is a joke. The marketing budget is clearly higher than the wages of the chef. (aka &quot;food assembly technician&quot;)  This chain of restaurants sells itself as being an authentic New York diner experiance. It has nostalgic black & white photographs of the city dotted around and an &quot;American-esque&quot; decor over all, but that's about as close as you'll get to the real exerpience.  If you've been to New York, you'll know that fantastic food is available almost every 20 paces, at low prices, and often in excessive quantities.  Unfortunately for Frankie and Benny's they offer a menu that is nothing like their marketing aspirations in either content, quality or quantity. What arrives on your plate is typically pre-prepared, frozen/microwaved type food, merely assembled onsite. Where the food is fresh, such as a steak, it's of poor quality, small, and overcooked - however often you ask for it be cooked the way you like.  The staff are full of good intentions in the restauarant, but their Head Office made the statement to me &quot; our typical customer hasn't visited New York, so don't we attempt to match the standards&quot;.  Tjat sums it up really, making maximum profit, with minimum effort, using excessive marketing veneer.  If you want sub-Beefeater quality, at equal or higher cost, with faux New York atmosphere, and don't mind eating anything you couldn't heat up yourself and paying for it - fill your boots.  I'd rather make my own burgers thanks. 
-4	Sat down to eat our meal when a mouse run out from under the counter, followed by a second one! When we told staff they just shrugged and said yes the place is infested! Burger King for us next time.
-4	 You can call it anything, but I am sorry, this is not authentic Italian food. In fact this has nothing to do with Italian food. Our salmon was not well cooked, let alone fresh. The spaghetti were so badly cooked, they became offensive to anyone who remotely understands Italian food. I would like this restaurant's manager to tell me what they mean exactly by &quot;authentic Italian&quot;. Perhaps they are referring to their soggy, over cooked, chopped off spaghetti or perhaps the frozen fish soaked in a sickly looking, whitish sauce. It is not surprising that they can't even manage to grill a perfectly &quot;British&quot; steak, after all, that should not be too &quot;foreign&quot; for them. Please do not call this Italian!!!!!! 
-4	 I popped to this drive through in my lunch hour. I arrived at 13:15 to find a queue (normal) which I joined. Once you join the queue at a drive through you're pretty committed as you can't get out usually. After 30 mins of waiting I ended up second in the queue at the order booth. 10 mins later the bloke in front still hadn't had his order taken. I walked to the window and explained that a number of us had now been stuck in the queue for over 40 mins. I asked if any freebies would be given as a good will gesture and the reply was. &quot;We only have two staff on and there's nothing I can do!&quot;.  I got back into my car and managed to cut over a high kerb, over the pavement and out of there and straight down the road to the nearest McDonald's where I received very quick and efficient service as usual from staff who are properly trained to deal with customers. 
-4	 Stood Inside the door where sign says, 'wait to be seated' no one came so after 5 mins we moved to the bar. There we were ignored for another 10 minutes despite making eye contact with 3 members of staff, standing there with my money in hand not one of them acknowledged us, even a 'be with you in a minute' would have been nice. Left and went somewhere more hospitable! 
-4	 Very nasty low grade stuff called food. Was it cooked? Hard to call it that. Was it served with care? No way. A pleasant meal - no way. AVOID! 
-4	 I am not wanting for words I made myself very known I wanted a Bradford curry not a local bowl of soup ...golly gosh what was dished up Lamb soup ....I did make my self very obvious I didn't want sauce I wanted thick dry curry The Real Stuff not the over priced super market attempt ... But even though I said out loud many times it was poor left without paying or eating ....but too be fair. ... Starters were excellent...but Cheltenham prices... This was on recommended advice by local bar Sam Smith's bar man did say if it's not good ...free pint ..guess what don't go to Sam Smith's Circus bar in Cheltenham...bar man not giving his word ....Tough . 
-4	Not a well run place to eat --- San Carlo Birmingham is far better.........  Service is sloppy........ Drinks are expensive..  Food is delivered a large white van from Brakes in Tamworth !!!!!!!!!11  Pretentious sums this place up...........
-4	 Do not waste your time with this appalling venue.  The food is horrendous.  The customer service is despicable.  The management clearly do not know what they are doing.  I came here with some friends a while back for some food and drink and the food was late, cold, uncooked and quite honestly; a joke.  I won't be coming here again; and I suggest that you don't too. 
-4	 We were told by the man on the till that there would be a 20 minute wait. Not a good start. Went to the cutlery and there were three knives left, two of which were not just dirty they still had food attached. Within minutes of sitting down (with one knife between us) it became clear that something was seriously wrong. The lady behind us had been waiting almost ONE HOUR for food and there was no food exiting the kitchen, in fact it appeared there was no cook! She challenged the man on the till and demanded to see a manager. Without her fortitude we may still be waiting now, but thankfully our meals arrived just over 45 minutes later. The food was good - considering - and the waiter apologised to everyone, but too little too late I'm afraid. Never again 
-4	 I was sad to see that such a lovely pub that has had a lovely refurb has become so badly run. The service was shocking, and it seemed we were interrupting the staffs social time with each other. The Parmesans tasted dry and out of date. When this was pointed out to the staff I couldn't believe the response when I was told it must be just me as she had had one before and there was nothing wrong with them! I was so appauled I never even wasted my time asking for a refund. We simply left and ate when we got home. Definitely one to avoid! 
-4	 Visiting Skipton with family and wanting lunch we just saw the window and did not realise it was a veggy, healthy place. This should not matter as we have eaten in plenty of similar places and had lovely food. I ordered a roasted peppers, etc. sandwich which was toasted and yet it was hard, cold and tasteless. Nobody in our party was happy with their choice but as it was a family outing nobody made a fuss except my wife who complained when asked by the staff if we enjoyed our meal. She had her money refunded. it was not the cheapest place we have been in either. 
-4	 What a shambles my boss actually said they felt mortified they booked this venue and never would again. My works doo was here on the weekend and the only thing I can praise about it was the DJ at least he saved us... slightly. One of our senior managers is gluten free and didn't receive any food for the whole night it was embarrassing, we did have a very pleasant but not completely with it waitress that tried to rectify the situation but as no point in time did any senior member come over to explain what was happening or even apologise. To be fair not many people seemed to have answers or no what was going on everyone at the table was discussing how it seemed the whole evening was left to the teenagers to manage, not professional at all.  I wanted that evening to kick start my Christmas countdown but even the Christmas vibe on the evening stopped in the entrance nothing inside the main hall which was a bit of a let down having a cracker does not scream ITS CHRISTMAS ENJOY YOURSELF which is exactly what you want from your staffs Party. I was lucky and managed to get some food however I can not scream and shout about it I am still undecided if I was one of the lucky ones.  I would really recommend you invest your money else where as upon leaving there was a common theme of let down with in our group.   Lastly I can complement the alcohol prices and the service behind the bar never did we have to wait more than 5 minutes to be served.   I never feel so strongly that I write about it but felt the need to warn people don't go with high expectations its not what you hope for.    
-4	 Went last Sunday for the carvary wasn't very good the Turkey was reformed meat the Yorkshire pudding was soggy and flat hardly any veg will not be going again and for the price there's much better pubs just down the road caister castle to name one 
-4	 Cafe Rouge was a disappointing food experience for family and I. There were barely any people in the restaurant and our starters took an hour and a half to arrive at our table. After we had all finished our starters it was an extra half an hour for them to realise we had finished. For our mains to come they took about 45 minutes. I would not recommend this restaurant. Eat here if you hate eating. 
-4	 The Swan With Two Necks has become another restaurant that is taking for granted that they can treat customers as if they are doing them a favour with poor food and arrogant none existent service. Having visited the Swan twice in the last few months this has now become a past favourite restaurant which we will never go back to.  On our first visit for my daughter’s 27th Birthday and pre wedding celebration, sitting in the 2 settees on the upper level from the bar area we were enjoying our second cocktails when in our opinion, an ignorant and arrogant waiter walks past us carrying 2 starters, disrespectfully shouting 'starters' AT us as he passed. He proceeded to place the starters randomly on the table and walked off. No ‘can I show you to your table’ or ‘your starters are ready’ just ‘STARTERS’. Carrying our own drinks to the table we sat down and waited 5 minutes for the other starters. My daughter was surprised/ shocked /upset by this rudeness and on her double celebration was compelled to complain to the manager about the lack of manners from the waiter who it transpired was the head waiter. Putting this minor but upsetting incident behind us as a one off and deciding everyone has a bad day, we attended the Swan with 4 friends from London as we hoped the food and service would be of a London quality.  What a mistake and what a totally diabolical night we had. I cannot exaggerate the embarrassment we felt. Arriving at 6.40 pm we sat outside on a beautiful ‘blazing sun’ evening with cocktail menus for 25 minutes until I had to get up to find a waiter to take our order. One guest asked if he could have a Vodka Martini with an olive. The waitress looked bewildered and walked off only for another waiter to return a few minutes later asking ‘what was the ‘special ‘ martini you wanted’. I have never known such a fuss about a martini. Having put up with numerous comments from our guests about how long we had waited for service, and now the drinks, the drinks finally arrived at 7.40 pm – 60 minutes after our arrival – with no olive in the martini, instead a lemon, a Margaritta with sugar around the rim having made it clear salt only and very poor almost rumless Zombies, the waiter commenting that the 6 cocktail order had ‘frozen the bar for 20 minutes’. I was forced to go indoors and ask for a glass with salt around it not sugar for the Margaritta. The waiter coming out a few minutes later with a glass with salt around it proceeded to pour the Margaritta from the sugared glass into the salted one in front of our 80 year old guest who just laughed at the amateurish service.  We then sat for a further 20 minutes to order food eventually giving up trying to get a waiter’s attention, with me again having to go inside to find someone to take our food order. After ordering food we then waited a further 25 minutes for someone to take our wine order and order more drinks. Concerned we would end up with food but no wine and everyone thirsty in the heat, I again went into the bar accompanied by my guest to order wine and some more drinks. After first asking the earlier cocktail waiter if we could order drinks and wine - who replied ‘I’ll do it in a second’ and walked off - we waited a couple of minutes with no joy and asked a second waiter who again walked off, my guest commenting his disbelief at the attitude. After another minute the head waiter appeared and I asked him if he could take a wine order. To which he replied ‘what table’. Explaining that we hadn’t yet sat inside and therefore didn’t know which table as we were sitting outside’ he replied ‘no you must tell your waiter outside’. By this time I was losing patience and told him what an appalling night we had experienced to which he amazingly replied ‘it has nothing to do with me, find your waitress’. Having a brief argument with him about his arrogant, couldn’t care less attitude we returned outside with the intention of cancelling our meal and leaving. Outside the manager was removing our cocktail glasses and I took the opportunity of saying loudly ‘what a joke this place has become with no service’ and ‘I’m so sorry but there is no wine or drinks for us, they’re too busy, shall we leave'? Within 30 seconds a waitress appeared who took our wine and drinks order. I needn’t have worried about the wine as we then waited a further 25 minutes before being asked to sit inside at 8.50 pm - 2 hours and 10 minutes after arriving. Four of our meals arrived soon after sitting down and after waiting 8 minutes for the other 3 meals I once again had to ask a passing waiter to find the missing meals. By the time they arrived my Thai Chicken kebab was cold and others expressed how their meal was cool. As I sat eating, the head waiter twice walked past staring threateningly at me. If I was not with guests I would have reacted to his provocation. The manger then came to ask if the meals were ok and after numerous negative comments about delayed and cold food he knelt beside me apologising to me for the problems we had experienced. He seemed taken aback at hearing of our problems and expressed ‘it’s not our normal service or standard’ we both agreed that no matter how popular a restaurant is ‘resting on reputation and laurels does not guarantee continued success’. To sum up our £250 night consisted of, delayed and poor cocktails; NONE EXISTENT – not poor or disappointing – SERVICE. I had to find a waiter on 5 separate occasions. There was no Cocktail order taken, food order or drinks orders taken without my involvement; Cold food served at different times and threatening looks from the head waiter.  If I was not so embarrassed by this experience in front of my guests I would have refused to pay for anything but didn’t want any further ‘scenes’. If this was the quality of service and food on a Tuesday night, I hate to think what it is like on a Friday or Saturday night. Socialising with friends since then I am amazed, but not surprised, at how many have had similar experiences and like us will not return to the Swan. Having sent a lengthy email outlining our experiences to the Swan’s owners; to give them the opportunity to apologise; we were promised that this ‘would be looked into’ but we are still awaiting a reply 6 weeks later. I think it is obvious where the arrogance and couldn’t care less attitude comes from. 
-4	 Pour house? More like poor house. If you want a burger that's a cross between a brick and ghandi's flip flop then you've found the right place. The service was laughable, the food indigestible. One establishment best to avoid. 
-4	 Having been here many times when the last managers were in place, we decided to give it a look now it's under new management. I wish we hadn't bothered. The first thing you notice is the &quot;Cash only&quot; signs on the bar. My beer was average, at best, and when my partner asked for a coffee, she might as well have been from Mars from the look she received. Once outside, the ashtrays we could see were full to overflowing, there were empty beer cans and bottles strewn about, and the whole place had a whiff of desperation. The people running could be seen, but not spoken to, sitting in the now-defunct restaurant enjoying a drink. Absolutely awful. 
-4	came here and was impressed with the new decor. was new lively and fresh. menu had a wide choice on it and was happy with the choice especially the Monday offer we had. cant complain on the food or service untill the end where i came down from the bar and seen in the kitchen. was a mess. thought id check the food rating and was shocked it was 2 star.  doubt ill be going back for a while unless it improves. with all the eateries around heswall you need to up your game.
-4	 Apparently this restaurant has recently been taken over and is now being run as a family business. This restaurant had a high pedigree for the foodies of Yorkshire & beyond it used to be a flagship consistently winning rave reviews from Cockcroft & Manby in the Yorkshire Post and not just accolades but awards too. Run and owned by William it was reknown I frequented it many times hyperbole was not lost on this premier eaterie. But it was more than that...a lot more..it was an institution..a way of life...it was de rigeur. Sadly it was then destroyed by someone who shall remain nameless. The mass alienation of its customer base followed. I could say a lot ..but the removal of the Brandy Chocolate Fudge was enough for me! So when I noted with relish that it was under new ownership I thought let's try it..call for a table..so I did to be met with an answer machine ..leave a message and we will call you back. No they don't call you back. So you decide to go down and ask why and you expect a sorry perhaps? What you don't expect is ..oh we were too busy ..to bother?..the inference being we could not care a less and she was a waitress and owner! Clueless and hopeless and totally unprofessional. The antithesis of the Drum which is now in the hands of idiots and the arrogance quite unbelievable. Jokingly i said well its 9 50 can you give us a table? No we have turned everything off and we are too busy anyway. What she should have said is listen we couldn't care a less go!! A restauranteur of repute would have apologised and said have a drink at the bar. Well William would I have lost count of the amount of the times I used to go down to the Drum at ten and catch Williams eye and get a table.I go almost misty eyed when I think of how that place was run. Now its in the hands of morons and I would never think for a minute of patronising it. In any event I would only be disappointed! 
-4	Went there with some friends for a drink one evening. We were told (not advised) that we could not sit at the vacant tables unless we were eating. Fair enough! However, we were also told that we could only sit in designated areas if we wanted to drink. These designated areas were completely full. I asked if we could sit in another area and 'jobsworth' staff reigned!  The staff were not only unfriendly, they were verging on rude. They all seemed to have a personality bypass.....no warmth, welcome or customer-focus. I would never return for a meal in the light of my experience as a drinking customer. My friends and I left after one drink and found a more welcoming hostelry.  Avoid like the plague, sadly :(
-4	 As A local couple we wanted to support local businesses so decided to take a walk down the prom and have a meal. We came across Morgan's and decided to try the food in there. We ordered a burger and the barbecue ribs and can only say that disappointment doesn't even come close to how we felt. Whilst the portions looked impressive on first glance it's a shame the food isn't the same. The ribs had next to no meat on them and we're bland. The burger was also bland and dry. The chips were hot yet looked anemic.  To summerise we spent £30 on an extremely disappointing meal then went on to spend the same again on a proper meal an hour later. It's no wonder local people stick to what they know!!!!! 
-4	 Having eaten here several years ago and looking for somewhere different to treat the kids, I thought...Damon's! I knew it was expensive but what I didn't know was the service and the food are now...POOR. And that's being kind. We booked, the kids were excited, all dressed up and off we went. Very busy, which was nice - as was the smell of cooking. Despite checking in 20 minutes early we were forgotten by the staff and consistently overlooked. When we reminded them we were waiting, we were eventually shown to our table where we were rushed through our ordering, eating and paying in less than 30 minutes. Not a very special experience. The waitress, although friendly enough, spent all of her time listening to us and watching us so she could pounce immediately we placed our cutlery back on the table. I couldn't wait to leave. £140 for a pitiful quantity of very average fries and ribs available in Asda for £1 made me realise just what service we get and what value our local Two for One pub is. We enjoyed the night in spite of the food and service not because of it. We won't be returning. My advice?....drive down the by-pass to The Pride of Lincoln..Have three nights out for the same price. Why on earth this place is so popular I do not know, 
-4	 Ever since the refurb of the cafe, the customer service has gone down the pan. Rude waiters and waitresses, could hear shouting from the back or kitchen, and costs waaayy to much just for a simple tasteless coffee and muffin. good views but sadly this is not enough to win back my custom.I would rather sit on the dunes with a flask of tea. 
-4	It was a terrible experience and i am not thinking of coming back. First of all, i know that it is supposed to be an informal restaurant, but having waiters playing around in the restaurant is ridiculous. Then...italian....if you do not know how to make a basic meal like lasagna or spaghetti bolognese (this two need tomato sauce...lots of it), please do not try to do anything else. I am portuguese and i know italian food, and if you thing that sprinkling some baby leaves over the food is enough because gives a &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;different&quot; image of italian, whoever picture this restaurant is wrong...please come back to basics, do not use dolmio sauce, do your own sauce with fresh tomatoes, use fresh food, fresh pasta, and please, sort out the staff.
-4	 Four of us had a lovely meal. Good service and food. Unfortunately, when we got back to our car we had a £60.00 parking ticket! I wouldn't mind, but we were one of about four cars in a car park for about 100 cars, in the dark, in February at 7:00pm!  The ticket was machine was in darkness and we foolishly assumed, like the rest of England, that car parking is free in the evening! Does the local authority want to encourage tourism? Obviously not! The restaurant was ok, but I won't be recommending it, as the fine almost doubled our costs for the evening and spoilt it! We'll go somewhere else next time...and not to Rock! 
-4	Went to Marrakesh for dinner with my daughter on Saturday night. We had been seated near the bar while we were eating our main course my daughter saw barman wipe sweat off his face and neck with his hand then picked up a bunch of mint and put them in teapot. That's just gross! Needless to say we didn't finish our meal.
-4	We used to order takeaway from here all the time, but do not know what has changed the staff are incredibly rude, and they keep delivering the wrong orders then when you call the chinese man says we've ordered the wrong food even though we always confirm the food and numbers! Last time my husband had to put the phone down on him as he was so angry! They couldn't care a less about losing custom as two of our friends have stopped ordering and we have emailed a complaint via their website twice to receive no response. Absolutely disgraceful! The food has gone completely done hill, have they changed the chef? Such a shame.
-4	 I came here on recommendation of a family member for a birthday meal sadly the pub have let them self down on this occasion where do I start hardly any food to offer as most things weren't available to order , when we did order something on the specials we were told they had none left this was at 1.30 ! The food took over a hour to come out and when it did we were disappointed with the small portions IE three roast potatoes each ! No stuffing , I think they knew they had messed up that day and the fact they had the to presented the full bill was a joke even so we paid and just wouldn't ever visit again nor will we recommend to anyone , it seems to be pleasant for many respectful elderly couples but the landlord needs to sort the menu and stock out and hire another chef on weekends , I would like to say the waitress was very kind tho I did feel sorry for her as she came out on four occasions to say what they did and didn't have. 
-4	Donner meat was horrible, and the chips tasted like theyed been refried 10 times then dunked in old musty oil... not impressed
-4	 Don't go here its crap. Went with friends it was terrible manager didn't want to know. Will not be going there anymore. Service and food was well below standard. 
-4	 This is a complaint about there car park. There car park is now permit only and the signs are on walls in small writing to notify unaware users (NOT very clear signs). Im a local and have parked there like so many do to pop to the cash point. I was there no more than two minutes & in that time I received an £60.00 (£61.50 with charge) £100.00 if not paid with in 28days.  The man who issued the ticket had only just stuck the ticket to my screen & was jumping back into his car when I returned. The man was parked at the back of the car park in a dark blue people carrier waiting to pounce on the cars parking there. I feel this is just another way for them to make money & this is for all those in the area that did not know this information. I just feel its discussing & I wont be using there services any more & I will do my best to discourage others using them too. 
-4	 If you are a family with children then notenthis resturant doesnt allow children after 7pm. Or so they say as we were spoken to about this whikt other tables were not. Steer clear unless you are a local. 
-4	 Arrived and greeted by surly owner. Although a couple, we ordered enough food for 4 as we wanted to try it all! We had to have a sandwich when we got home - that's how small the portions are. Annoyed that although not licenced, they still charge corkage for drinks we bring. Green curry with chicken was mostly cauliflower and the chicken would comfortably fit in a tablespoon. Added to the fact that we were repeatedly ignored by the waiter whilst he was overly friendly to other tables, and the bill was the most we've ever paid for a Thai meal, and we won't be going back. I could go on and on, I'm so annoyed! Avoid at all costs. 
-4	 Visited here in a Sunday evening. When the kitchen staff are getting annoyed with the waiting staff you know it's going to be poor. Absolutely dreadful service. Forgot to bring the drinks? Left us sitting at our table? In the end we had to get up and ask for our bill and there was not one ounce of apology. If you want to eat in Bristol then go someone else as this place really doesn't deserve anyone's money 
-4	 Enjoyment of a reasonable Sunday lunch spoilt by the establishments refusal to supply any sort of vegetarian sauce to accompany one of our parties main meal. Will eat elsewhere when we're back in Addingham. 
-4	 In summary far and away the most unprofessional dining experience of my life. The Manageress' attitude was appalling: Here are the facts:  Table booked at set time of 8.15, as per all their customers, so they knew how many Customers were in and at what time. They had been told it was our Anniversary and they had committed to ‘pulling out all the stops’. We had been told, by them, that both the Al a Carte or Valentine’s menu would be made available - this had been specifically checked. So this is how our evening passed:  Arrived: Booking name checked; Coats taken and then we were left standing in reception for 10 minutes with no explanation. All passing staff deliberately avoiding eye contact; no communication from any of them. Not a single smile or sign of enjoyment from any member of staff. Alarm bells ring. Pre-meal seating area with bar was full. So they tried to create extra seating by using two spare poufs (i.e. foot rest) and an old coffee table at the edge of the bar, close to the room doorway. All the other seats were proper seats with proper tables. We made it clear this was unacceptable, so asked to be taken straight to our table. Vague apology stating the obvious that it was busy, like they were surprised it was busy. Table had not been finished being laid ready when we were sat down. Table setup same as every other table (i.e., no Anniversary mentioned). The Rose had already wilted. Table was loose, wobbling. Table was set next to the work area for staff where there are no doors; therefore a busy thoroughfare.  Took a further 20 minutes to supply a menu. Provided both Valentines and Al a Carte menu.  No drinks menu. Choice of drinks was extremely limited if you don’t drink wine.   Countless passes by staff who ignored us. Continual look of disarray and lack of teamwork or even experience from staff. Table name checked again. “Sorry, what is your name again?” Took 25 minutes to return to the table to take the order. Total time at ‘Restaurant’ now 55 minutes.  We made our main complaint to the woman that appeared to be managing. She actually argued with us in the middle of the restaurant stating that because it was so busy (again, making out that in some way this annually occurring Christian event somehow took them by surprise) they weren’t able to cope with all the customers and so everyone had to wait.   Decided, due to it being past 9pm and our taxi ride was 25 minutes back, that we would allow them the opportunity to take our order – perhaps the food would save them. We had chosen from the Al a Carte menu (which you had taken confirmation of it’s use just a couple of days before), only to be told that they weren’t serving from it, the choice was limited to the Valentine’s menu. As my Wife doesn’t typically eat fish, and the menu was fish heavy, this was the final straw.  Woman told to order us a Taxi  Table booking name checked again.  Absolutely no effort to remedy the situation; it was quite apparent that she was glad to see us go supplying us with obnoxious farewells and smiles as we left.  Incidentally, no raised voices, so no-one else in the restaurant would have known about the dispute, in respect of their Valentine’s evening.  Back at our Hotel by 2200. No food eaten. Hotel du Vin saved the evening with fantastic service and food.  I think that summarises their incompetence clearly. 
-4	I loved coming here. I always ordered the American Pale Ale, a fantastic drink. Anyway, I came here a few weeks ago with my friend and the service was shocking. I don't mean they were busy and forgot to serve me, etc... I mean, literally awful. The bar was empty and the two guys on shift ignored me and continued having a laugh whilst rolling cigarettes. Then, when they finally did serve me, I didn't get an apology. (This happened a couple of times that night.) During my final drink that evening, one of the men was texting whilst taking my order, and he continued texting whilst pulling my pints. I didn't get a thank you for my purchase/no eye contact either. Instead I was completely ignored like I was an inconvenience.   Now, I actually work in customer service. If I did any of this whilst on shift, I would have been sacked for awful behaviour. Whoever employed these two guys need to rethink their decision.
-4	 This place was a joke from start to finish. My family came to visit for the theatre and have a meal and we picked the living room because it looked nice from the outside. We then informed the staff we had an hour to eat before we had to leave before the show.  No problem they replied, may I add that only one other table was taken.  The food turned up late, so we left half way through not to miss the show. The staff walked past several times never checked on us, spilt food on my mother. I had to go and ask to order more drinks.  The the final straw was then the waiter claimed it wasn't his fault as he'd only just started when he actually took our order. I asked to speak to the manager, she was to busy changing a barrel in the bar.   I replied no problem I'll wait, staff reply again from the manager was &quot;she will still be busy, why are you been like this for what is your problem?&quot;  The bar is empty she has time to speak to me, we are always quiet was the final remark and I can see why.  I tried to call head office but no one has got back to me. This is the first ever negative review I have ever give anywhere. But my family and I think it was well earned.  Living Room retrain you rude staff, and get your manager to care about the few customers you have. 
-4	 Waited 30 mins for service- another 45 for a rusty old burger and steak! Waiter service along with food was terrible. I last came here in january things have gone down hill so much! 
-4	 This place has to be one of the most overpriced places I have been to in a long while. The set menu I went on was £25 for 3 courses which would be an expectable amount to pay if I was given expectable value for money. First of all you get very view options to choose from on the menu so I you are not in the mood for duck or beetroot then be prepared to pay the ridiculously high regular menu prices. Then you get the starter which for me was the lamb croquettes but in my opinion it is less of a starter and more of a taster for one you get a total of 2 small croquettes which seemed to be OK tasting but still not to an amazing quality. Next we had to main course where I had the duck leg which appeared to have been cooked well and the meat was to an OK quality but their was nothing to complement it no sauce or spice, just plain duck leg and yet again the portion size was very small you got a single duck leg and, some mash a few vegetables and what appears to be some sort of fruit I left feeling still quite hungry and I'm only a regular sized man with a regular size appetite so if you're someone with a large appetite then be prepared to go hungry. Then we get to dessert where I had the apple trifle which again was OK tasting but still pretty average as things go.  But the thing that really tipped to iceberg was the companies poor business ethics. First of all their is a service charge of 12.5% and bear and the set menu was £25 each that works out as £3.10 each just for the tip and I believe personally the servers should earn their tips and how much they get should be up to me and the quality of service I believe I have received that evening, not for it to be forced on me by the company. It was also someone's Birthday on the table and we also made a simple request if we could have the Birthday cake for dessert which is a basic request which in the dozens of places have been happy to do in the past, but at this restaurant they wanted to charge us £6 each to eat are own cake that we had bought with are own money.   This place is a giant waste of money it's not new and trendy it's just a rip off. 
-4	 We have eaten many places in the surrounding area and this is definitely the most inferior. My wife and I have never experienced such poor service, food quality or customer service as we did here. It started with an invitation to their new menu tasting where on being seated were informed that some of the half a dozen choices on the menu were not available.  We then decided not to eat from this menu but to choose from the existing black board on the wall ,etc. I ordered steak medium rare but unfortunately had to send it back three times. The management agreed to change my order but by then my partner had finished hers. I went on to order Lamb Cutlets only to be told that I would not like them if I didn't like the steak. I ended up having a burger which was dry and very unappetising. When we complained on our exit the management were not that interested and we still had to pay full price for what we had. We proceeded to complain to head office but they were no more interested than the management at Farmer Johns. When you complain to head office the complaint automatically gets sent onto the place that you are complaining about. If the management at the venue are not interested in customer service at the time what chance is there of them being interested afterwards????? 
-4	We visited Shaka Zulu with my partner for my 33rd birthday and what an awful disappointment this was. Even more after the bill arrived. On entering the restaurant the atmosphere was looking great with all the walls and ceiling resembling the entrance to sacred tribe’s cave and the music was in line too and it was some joyful African songs of some sort. First impression was great and it looked like a well-run upmarket restaurant but then everything turned pretty poor pretty quick. We had to wait more than 5 min for someone to come to the front desk and welcome us and take us to our table. The person who greeted us told us in an abrupt manner that we can only have the table for 1.5 hours which and even though it was my birthday and I was happy his emotionless face a bit too much for me. Unfortunately the poor experience didn’t stop there. Even though it was a Sunday night and there were only about 10 tables full on the top floor and no one on the floor below it took 10 min to one of the many waiters to bring us menus and take drink orders. The menu was rather rich but the big surprise was in the prices. £15 for a starter and £30-£85 for a main is too much for a themed restaurant in Camden’s Stable Market and we quickly realised why there were so few diners in there. It was my birthday after all so we ordered a few exotic game meats and a couple of starters and some sides. The crocodile spring rolls starter I had tasted like a spring roll from our local Chinese takeaway and I couldn’t really taste any different flavour from the tiny piece of meat inside it. My main was their signature dish the King Shaka Game Meat Board and it included grilled ostrich, zebra, boerewors and antelope springbok. I liked the springbok and the zebra but the dish was just few pieces of grilled meat and some sauces. It felt like having a beef steak. Nothing to show that it was an exotic game meat (except the ridiculously high price of course). I would also add that even though the restaurant was not busy at all we had to see 5 different waiters before we can order food and drinks and the cocktails we ordered were overpriced too - £20 for a cocktail is way too much. There was no hand soap in the toilets and I had to ask the staff to get it refilled. We paid £180 bill which is too much for a dinner for two. We would certainly not visit again but we would not recommend any of our friends and family to visit either.
-4	Having just finished a lovely summer walk with friends over the chase we thought it would be fitting to treat our Australian friends to a bite to eat.  We had used the Barley Mow before so didn't think we would have any issues -How we were wrong.  We were promptly led to our tables but found ourselves in a booth with a television playing extremely loudly - The TV was actually built into the wall of our booth. We requested that the volume be turned down to which the waiter replied &quot;We've lost the remote&quot; no attempt at an apology was made. We then asked to be moved and were told there were no other seats available - Yes it was a busy day but we could quite clearly see available seating areas.  Okay so we would have to sit through extremely annoying background noise from the television but we decided to get on with it and order our meals.  I ordered the &quot;Hand battered haddock&quot; and have to say that I would have preferred it if it wasn't hand battered. The batter was terrible and literally dripping in fat. The fish tasted more like Pollock or another cheap white fish alternative and to top it off it was riddled with bones and served with cold chips & mushy peas. I had also ordered some bread and butter to accompany the dish and was not supplied with any butter until asking three times to have some brought to me (by which time I had already finished my meal).  All of the above is trivial but now I move onto the more worrying part of this review.  My partner ordered the &quot;Chicken sharer&quot; (Which by the way isn't big enough to share between two three year olds let alone two adults) and was disgusted to find out that when she bit into one of the goujons it was stone cold in the middle. The chicken hadn't been defrosted thoroughly and actually hurt her teeth slightly it was that frozen in the centre. An absolute outrage and although I accept the chicken was obviously pre-cooked very dangerous.  It was at that point that we got up and left - hurrying to pay and attempting to apologise to our friends for taking them to such an appalling &quot;restaurant&quot;. We definitely will not be going again and would advise anyone trying to impress friends/family/relatives to steer clear. I wouldn't let my arch enemy eat in this establishment.   Would give 0 stars if Trip Advisor allowed us too.
-4	 I am actually sat in this establishment as I type. There are dirty glasses and plates piled high both behind an actually on the bar, the place is littered through out with empty plates of food and glasses ( some plates at our bench table have been there for 45 minutes), there are unwiped tables throughout,some of which are heavily soiled. Service was also pathetically slow. 10 minutes to order a bottle of wine and two glasses ( my ordering was twice interrupted whilst the bartender took calls  AVOID!! 
-4	 I don't usually post poor reviews but I think in this case I must we are staying at the premier inn and booked breakfast as we usually do as in the pasted we have had nothing but good food and service but this one was totally rubbish the young lad who was cooking the food was out of his depth as it was very busy and he was on his own this meant he cooked the sausage and bacon but ran out of eggs and tomatoes by the time these were cooked he had run out of bacon and sausage again this became an unending cycle for the poor lad we complained to the duty manager who's attitude was if you have a problem tell the premier inn which we did and to their plays gave us a complete refund. This is the first time we have had a problem so won't stop us using these establishments but won't be having breakfast at this one again 
-4	 I attended here for a quiet drink after work and the toliets were dirty and they stunk. The tables are sticky and grubby. Their attitudes towards customers is horrendus and the service was awful instead of them saying hello how may i help you, They just asked &quot;what do you want!&quot; Was accused of having too much to drink even though they could understand what i was saying, not being rude or lary or paraletic.which was not possible because i just finished work ( probarly because they wanted to close early). probarly the most rude and depressing place i been to and the food is not great either will not be setting foot in that place again and i will not be reccomending this place to others either!!!! 
-4	 Just been back to see how dawlish is after the storms, one good thing that's come out of it is it looks like this so called cafe is closed down. Our last visit to the beach cafe was a very unpleasant experience. The smell that greets you as you enter is like an old folks home, the food..... Well let's just say I wouldn't give it to my dog. And the owners/staff were soo rude and unpleasant. I wouldn't recommend the beach cafe to my worst enemy. 
-4	 We were seated upstairs and it was very cold. So cold I kept my coat on for most of the meal so we really just wanted to eat and leave. My husband really enjoyed his meal but my duck had very little sauce with it which made the meal quite dry. On a positive note the service was very jolly and attentive. The atmosphere and music appeared much more like a french brasserie experience downstairs (and warmer). 
-4	 Had to visit Reigate on business and checked to see which restaurants close by would be worthy of a visit for lunch. According to the Gey Rhino website they're open for lunch. We arrived to see the menu displayed externally and confirmation of opening hours. We entered the front door but at the top of the staircase the door to the restaurant was locked. OK maybe closed due to some emergency, these things happen. But we phoned to check and we were told they're only open in the evening. Some people are in business in spite of themselves. Luckily Reigate has plenty of eateries who can be bothered to open for lunch in accordance with published times! 
-4	 We had booked a table at 8pm on the trip up to Newcastle to see family and were genuinely exited by the look and reviews of Osaka.  But when we arrived everything decended into chaos.  First we were asked if we would mind giving them 10 minutes and going for a drink as they were behind and there were no tables. Having reserved a table I found this odd but having worked in restaurants before could understand, so we left and grabbed a quick cocktail and half pint before returning 15 later.  Entering for the second time it was quite obvious no tables were empty but I kindly told the girl that I had a reservation and we had came back from a drink because of table issues 15 minutes earlier.  We were left awkwardly at the door towering over everyone while the staff seemed genuinely disorganised and after 5 minutes I approached the chequeout desk to ask how long they thought a table would be but hardly got a word out before I was told '1 second please' and shooed away.  We were then approached and told someone was leaving and a table would be free and we decided to stand outside and have a cigarette to wait... Clearly aggrevated now and really quite disappointed. After a cigarette we started searching for another restaurant and found St. Sushi (a beautiful larger restaurant around the corner) who had a table ready in 10 minutes for us and managed to organise themselves in that time (not having the 12 hours Osaka had)  In total the table we had booked half a day earlier at Osaka was still unavailable 30 minutes after our initial reservation. Considering there was one man at a four person table I don't think Osaka had there game faces on that night in the slightest.   Sorely disappointed.  Osaka next time when someone reserves a table... Actually reserve it. 
-4	 After waiting 10 minuets and eventually flagging down a waiter we made our order told there was a half hour wait on food which we accepted, the drinks came 10 minuets later, I ordered a coke and was given a diet coke which wasn't a problem. So after waiting 50 minuets for our food I went to the bar to ask how long it would be and they said they hadn't been given an order and that we had obviously made the mistake in forgetting to order our food. So on this note we decided to leave as the waiter that took our order sheepishly hid in the corner knowing she had done wrong, and we were rudely spoke to saying 'what drinks have you had cause you've drunk them so you can pay for them'. The place has been going down hill for a while know as services has got worse and food portions smaller. The place was cluttered with used mugs and cutlery as no one could be bothered to collect them and the table next to use eventually resorted to cleaning it up them self while the 3 girls on service stood and talked. It must be a family member who owns the business or I wouldn't see why anyone would not sack them. Has been going for years but I understand it has taken over by a different family and has been getting worse each time will not be visiting again. 
-4	 Food was tasty but not amazing. Waiting staff did their best but were stretched. The manager was extremely rude, abrupt and unwelcoming. I will not be returning. 
-4	Terrible atmosphere - was threatened with violence by a customer for no reason. Also staff were surly and arrogant. Food was poor and too expensive. Avoid.
-4	 Having read the reviews regarding the restaurant side of the pub i was really looking forward to my visit, i believe the small independent pubs are a treasure that should be  Cherished and supported, i have drank at the pub periodically for a good few years and found the quality of the beers offered always to be first class, however the food element of the lion is well below the high standards of the wet side. The enviroment is very pleasant, a nice intimate dining room, however thats the best i can offer as a positive. The service staff appear to be the most stressed servers i have come across, their service skills are sadly lacking, why are they waliking about with a grubby looking tea towel over their shoulder, not a hygienic practice surely? When they deliver dishes to your table why do you have to ask for obvious accompliments, vinegar, tartare sauce etc. its basic . And one of the strangest things is the bill, we had starters, mains, wine,beers surely an itemised bill is expected not just an end figure, with no breakdown of items. I hope the owners sort the service staff issue, and the soggy chips. I will try the lion again in the future because we need good independents, please get your food side as good as your wet. 
-4	We had a table booked for 11 people and two babies which I would have thought would warrent some special attention given a such a large group but we were squeezed into a booth which would accommodate 6 people only so we ate with 'elbows in' Ignored in terms of menu provision. They offered Sunday lunch but when we ordered at 13:30 there was no beef left. Poor food quality and portion size (one sprig of broccoli!). Took an age to come. Didn't offer deserts and when we ordered coffee they told us they had run out of beans.  A great little drinking pub or light snacks for sure but don't go expecing a decent Sunday lunch with a large group.  Oh and the toilets are disgusting (even my two-year-old boy said it smelled like piggies!)
-4	 This place has high aspirations, but fails completely because the service is so incredibly inept and rude. We had a group of nine people in (for which we had pre-booked), and when we arrived the place was empty. So you'd think they'd be falling all over themselves to treat us well. Instead, we were treated with poorly concealed contempt (clearly we were too much bother). Such a shame because the food was quite good. But we won't EVER go back. When asked at the end of the night what we thought, our response was clearly not taken on board. But we were happy to hear a voice behind us say that they agreed about the service. We are not alone in thinking they need to learn a lot about customer service as I've read several other reviews that offer the same feedback. There are MANY other places to go in Forest Hill, and we'll definitely be taking our business elsewhere. They are a complete embarassment to the area. 
-4	Very disgusted. Service was appalling by the Manager named Stacey. Very arrogant. Had no respect and interrupted a private chat. We understand we couldn't eat food from elsewhere there but she had the decency to wipe out the menu from our side and slam it on the table and told us arrogantly you cannot eat other things here. I understand that but the approach could've been more professional. We were not happy with our time there. We have regular Study talks along with a nice meal often but because of this person tonight was appalling and we are reconsidering whether my friends want to continue returning again or not. Very Displeased....
-4	 First time at baileys. Was recommended by a friend. First impression.... Really nice place, cool decor, good banter from the bar staff, impressive looking menu. Decided to order nachos, which I am a big fan of and was quite excited about. However what turned up on my table was not even close to nachos. It was a plate with sweet chilli Doritos, salad (??), beef chilli and out of the packet unmelted grated cheese. No guacamole... No sour cream... I was massively disappointed and when this was brought up with the management, they were very defensive and dismissive. They claimed that 'this is how baileys do nachos' well in that case, you shouldn't call them nachos... Or should at least give the customer an indication of what they are going to receive as the cost for this bowl of Doritos was £9.25!!!  I got the impression that this choice has been complained about before as the manager seemed to have a pre-prepared speech ready. I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience here and I shall certainly jot be returning. And that is my advice to anyone. BOOM.  
-4	 garbage drinks. garbage service. garbage venue. all i can say anout this place is garbage. Avoid at all costs, the food taste like dort, bartenders are rude and short change and managment are ignorant. 
-4	 I never complain in restaurants because I have never really had to but last night, the experience fell a mile short of a good night out.   This is the second time I have been to Made in Italy on the Kings Rd and the second time I have left furious. The first time was on my birthday nearly 18 months ago and people came from all over London for it and that was abysmal, no choice of pizza, very overpriced and shocking service. There were 20 of us there and cost per head was similar to last night at £47 each. When a friend suggested we go to yours again I was already apprehensive.   The starters and the platters of meat etc were good, very good in fact. But the pizzas are just not up to much, it is like you really don’t care, either they had very little cheese on them so were almost exclusively tomato or they were over flowing with cheese. Generally you brought out a selection of very boring pizzas, why don’t you ask people what they want. The only pizza anyone actually wanted was the Pepperoni pizza.   We then ordered a second lot of pizzas so at least we might get some choice of what we could have. I asked the waiter for pizza with pepperoni, cheese and some olives (A pretty standard meat pizza), and that is literally what we got, pizza base, entirely cheese but peppers (the vegetable) no pepperoni and a few olives. I couldn’t have been more specific.  Then when the pudding came, the waiter gave us no choice, just coffee Tiramisu. To make things worse it was clear that half had been either left out in a warm kitchen and the others had been in the fridge. It didn’t taste great and was basically very soggy. Again it’s like you just don’t care.  The service was shocking too, the staff really couldn’t care if we were there or not and clearly their English is not good enough either. If your staff can’t be bothered get rid of them, its London, there are thousands of people looking for work. They ignored us, they weren’t friendly, they didn’t smile etc  What really annoyed me and I think most of us was the price. Firstly 12.5% is excessive and a European service charge rate. £47 for that evening was just far too much even if it had been perfect, we basically got ¾ of a bottle each, starters, thee pieces of pizza and a pudding. I can only imagine that people paid it because they were too worried about offending the birthday girl.   Its really embarrassing taking people out and then having so many people disappointed, what’s the point? The manager I spoke to afterwards tried to give us more Limoncello but it was too little too late.   What you have at Made in Italy is a great concept, the starters are excellent, the idea of the metres of pizza is great but that’s about it. Your pizzas are so basic in ingredients that it becomes a chore eating them. It’s not supposed to be Pizza hut, thank God it isn’t but if you compare yourself to Pizza Express they would beat you hands down. They have plenty of tomato, plenty of cheese, “herbs”, meat etc, you can’t just rely on the fact that you use Pizza ovens for your uniqueness.  The manager said he had been there for two weeks and that things were going to improve. They really need to. Whats more they dont reply to complaints, hence me on here, they were given at least two weeks to return reply to my complaint. 
-4	 This was not my choice of restaurant. I checked the reviews posted by others before I went to this restaurant last night. I paid particular attention to the negative reviews and would say that the restaurant proprietors have not taken heed. We were a party of 9 and had booked a table for 7:30 p.m. Two of the starters were delivered after repeated requests and by the time they had arrived the other members of the party had finished.We didn't get our main courses until 9:50 p.m. Guests at other tables who arrived after us were served ahead of us. Some of the mains were lukewarm although mine was hot and tasty. We had to scrutinise the handwritten bill to ensure that the charge for one of the mains was deducted as the wrong dish had been served up and apparently was not up to standard. The waiter who told us that the charge would be deducted had failed to follow this through. The final bill was presented and although we could identify the food items listed the charge for drinks was not itemised and so it was shown as one amount. We estimated the cost of it all and were satisfied that it appeared to be in the region of what we would have expected. The waiters were non-attentive. Having complained about the inadequacies the manager did present us with a complementary bottle of red wine. We paid the bill and did not leave any tip. I will need a lot of persuading before I dine there again. 
-4	 We went in a few weeks ago, there was four of us. We hadn't booked, but the restaurant was busy, so we were happy to wait. So we had a beer each and waited.  A party of 5 came in a little while later and were shown to a table ahead of us! So we felt we would rather go somewhere else. This is not acceptable service, I won't be going back there any time soon!!! 
-4	 Have been regular customers at this pub for a meal im very sorry to say that over the last few weeks the standard of thd meals has gone down,new chef and the meals are Even worse my wife left hers last w eek and my friends woifes chicken was still pink and raw definitely be giving it a miss from now on 
-4	 From the moment we walked through the door to leaving this was a bad experience.  We arrived and we were half greeted by a passing waitress, who I felt we were interrupting. She asked us to look at her list of bookings for a name we recognised as we were meeting friends and didn't know what name the booking was. None the wiser I suggested could we order some drinks to which she pointed to some chairs and walked off, after 10 minutes and no offer of a drinks order our friends arrived.  We were escorted to a table with a wet table cloth, we requested to move and were greeted by yet more wet table linen. However on the plus side we had now gone from paper napkins to linen. We didn't get to sit down, we waited while another table was set this time with a paper table cloth and linen napkins...these were later removed and replaced with a stack of small triangular cheap paper napkins on the corner of the table.  Next a 15 minute wait for drinks order and 10 minute wait for them to be brought with small pathetic looking wine glasses, covered in finger prints  , The banquet was chosen by all Soup was best described as bovril at best.  Mixed starters: the spring rolls were small in length, thin like pencils, and due to this the filling was barely tastable. The pawn toast was thick, and probably the best item on the plate. The ribs were plenty big enough in size, but had enough meat on for a small mouthful.   The duck and pancakes came, and the duck was taken halfway across the Resturant to be shredded, giving the cold pancakes enough time to reach room temperature, so they went back and 5 minutes later returned when the duck had cooled enough to spark yet further annoyance.   Main course came and the sizzling streak nicely splattered the entire table without much warning...the prawns I don't eat so can't comment, the steak was delicious, at last some positive. The satay dish was quite possibly the worst tasting satay I've ever had, and I like satay dishes, the look was not great and the texture slimey. The rice wasn't much to be desired either it was very stodgy, didn't come across as being freshly made.  Quite an effort to get anyone's attention to ask for the bill and then at this stage I just wanted to leave, I stood up and paid on my way out.   They don't do Amax, even though they think they do...[sigh]...they can't even get that right with telling me incorrect information. 
-4	You need to serve the people that arrive first at the drive-thru first. Rather than have me pull up, sit there with my window open getting wet for a minute, then have someone pull up at the other order point and have someone take their order straight away. You've lost my custom on three occasions now. Fast food means fast food, not wait there like a numpty to get jumped in the queue.
-4	 The prices are a joke for what is basically frozen then deep fried food.. And they do need to redecorate.. The '70s are long gone.   If you do decide to visit take a look in the cake display.. I am curious as to how long the bowl of strawberries will be left rotting away in there before they are either removed, are eaten by some poor unfortunate soul with bad eyesight, or evolve into a new life form and escape on their own accord. 
-4	 We turned up for a goodbye to a close friend who was going abroad to work. 16 of us were ushered upstairs to a mezzanine type level. We hadnt even all sat down before a waiter came up to tell us to keep the noise down and we were stamping our feet!!! We were extremely polite and assured them we were not being rowdy. Ages ranged between 45 and early 50's so we were not a larey bunch of kids! Anyway five minutes later a different waiter came up and rudely told ua to quieten down or we would be asked to leave. At which point we decided to leave anyway and his tune changed trying to convince us to stay! As we left we noticed only a table of4 and a table of 2 left in the restaurant!?!? Their loss as we reconvened at the best Indian in Plymouth,the Eastern Eye where a fantastic evening and meal was enjoyed by all. Bizarre treatment of a group of friends who regularly go out for food ina group of 12+ and never have any problem or get treated like this.Never again. 
-4	 Popped in for an impromtu lunch and left very disappointed. We had an asparagus starter with duck egg.. hmm in the middle of the UK asparagus season and had 3 very small stems and what must have been a very anaemic duck egg.. £7.50 ! cost of goods was easily under a pound.. also had the ribeye steak.. asked for rare but were told that they couldn't guarentee rare as they were too thin and may come medium.. erm... speachless. We also asked for bernaise sauce (after they forgot) and they brought out a pot of sauce with a sprig of tarragon in.. on tasting it was hollandaise, so we asked the waiter who decided to argue wih us and tell us we were wrong.. hmm.. perhaps he didn't realise that we are both chefs and restauranteurs so we may know a bit more about these things than him.. Not only will we not return but we will be telling others not to.. shame as it used to be good... 
-4	 Went to give the restaurant a final try since its refurb, Wished I had not satay chicken undercooked when we complained were told it was pink due to the food colouring(rubbish the whole piece would have been pink) dishes were lukewarm and halfway through the first platefull we started to feel ill only consolation was Manager after laughing with his staff about it all charged us for 1 dinner only.  Will never ever go back to this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
-4	 Went to the Fieldhead for a family roast today (Sunday) .... it was awful... the menu stated &quot;perfect Sunday Roast&quot; how wrong could they have been... the meat was tough and tasted disgusting, the veg was warm but not cooked at all, the mashed potato was basically out a packet and the gravy had solid lumps in it ... we had the manager over to complain to which he replied &quot;I can get you replacement meals but they will be no better&quot; they offered me and my brother turkey and chips... not quite the Sunday roast we went out for. The Manager thought that 18 chips and two slices of turkey was good value for money as a direct replacement for our meal.... which was £9.99!!! This hotel/pub is an absolute disgrace. The manager openly admitted that none of the food is prepared on site but is all prepared and bought in by an external company and then Fieldhead just warm it up in their kitchen, so basically ping food, people be aware this place is awful!!! 
-4	 I had a veggie chilli burrito which was very bland and dry, definitely not worth the cost of £10.95 and to add insult to injury didn't even get any pop corn as a pre amble. 
-4	Living local and a kind of regular, I decided to pop in there on a monday night after getting off a plane from Spain. Being used to manana manana I had to wait an eternity for a simple burger. When it eventually arrived it was so burnt that it was actually black on both sides and the bun itself was rock hard. I told the waiter he must be joking and was told I was being rude. I insisted on speaking to the manger and instead got an immature assistant manageress who told me that she did not like my attitude. Actually I had 3 staff members ganging up trying to downgrade myself.  I was even told that I was not a regular and have never been seen even though myself and family have been going to this pub for many years. All I can say is support the real local pubs that are not owned by big corporations and run by staff who think they can take your money and answer you back. I thought the customer had rights, not in this pub. Funny, I ask for a complaints form and instead got a survey to fill in. How can anything change when they are there just to take your money! Good luck
-4	 Sorry but the app wont let me put the correct it was outstanding was great to get 2 for one on stakes best ever for a long time and the grandson loved his pie chips and peas and ice cream 
-4	 We wait 15 min for our drink and popodoms !!The waitress cant speak properly,her english was funny,she cant understand what I want and she look so rude.After that a fat waiter came to take our order and he force us to eat some fishy thing which we didnt like.He cant force a customer to eat from his choice ! He was annoying.Food was good.Service was slow.I dont think I will come here again. 
-4	 I organised a dinner here for a works Christmas night out. The staff were utterly useless not waiting the tables resulting in most of us walking up and downstairs to order and collect drinks all night. The food was not what I expected at all for the price we was paying at £25 per head plus drinks, it was poor to say the least. But the worst is still to come. After waiting 30 mins from plates being cleared for our main course I asked if we could have the mains brought out ASAP as we had reservations elsewhere that evening for drinks. The extremely rude waitress argued the length of time we had been waiting and insisted that this was normal and walking away with a great deal of attitude.   The 12 out of 14 mains then arrived very late. As a close group nobody wanted to start eating until all the food was served. 15 minutes after waiting for the 2 vegetarian dishes to arrive I had to physically knock on the kitchen door for service to be told the chef hadn't prepared the required nut roast dishes for the two vegetarians in our dinner party and they only had 1 not 2. One of the two vegetarians just request to have a plate of vegetables as everyone else was waiting and by this point all our dinners had gone cold. (Bare in mind all the food was per ordered from a set menu a week before we went)  Again a very very delayed time before dessert was served with a great amount of attitude from the waiting staff. Half of party had to leave prior to finishing the food as we had a table booked for drinks that needed to be saved at a different venue for the remainder of the evening.   To top it off I stayed behind to pick the drinks bill up for the evening so my party could try to salvage to table in the night club. And what did they do but dramatically over charge, which they admitted. When I asked about any compensation for the £25 meal that they couldnt produce I was faced with a blunt glaze. None being given.  At which point I left. On my way out another Xmas party group commented saying there meal was just as awful....  Save your money and your night out and go elsewhere!!!!! 
-4	 Having been to Azzurro's before and had decent food in a lively and fun atmospehere we thought it was a good place to take friends who needed to get into (and back out from) Waterloo. What a mistake, the service was awful - took over an hour to get starters despite repeated requests and reminders and even a jug of water seemed to be beyond the staff. Whilst apologetic they did nothing to improve the situation and it was clear from others in neighbouring tables that we were not the only ones getting this treatment. Food was adequate but not worth the wait. 
-4	I wrote this to their website after I was completely messed about by them. This is my only was of exercising my consumer rights without suing them. I dont want to waste any more time by adjusting the mail I sent via their website so please take it in the first person as it was written. I believe it is fairly self-explanatory. DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE. PLENTY OF VERY GOOD ALTERNATIVES IN THE AREA.  I have been ordering from you for years. The way I was treated on Saturday night was so unacceptable I am writing to you for one last attempt before I write critical reviews to Hardens, Trip Advisor and anyone else who might convince you to stop treating your faithful customers like fools.  I ordered delivery from you on Saturday evening at 7pm. I was told it would take 40 minutes. At 8.30 I called to ask what the delay was and the man I had made the order with told me it would be better to come and collect it. I asked him why he had a. Said 40 minutes and b. Not called to let me know. I asked for the manager and he said that he would ensure to deliver it &quot;in two minutes&quot;. At 9pm - two hours later - the food arrived. Ironically the chit – which I still have – stated my delivery was “estimated for 20:12hrs.   I had a business client at home for a casual dinner. When I unpacked the starters I realised the usual dip for the Onion Baji was missing. I called back and the man simply said &quot;Sorry, there is nothing I can do&quot;. I then unpacked the rest and found one of the main courses was missing, specifically the one I ordered for my client. I called back, now angry, and was again told “sorry”. I asked &quot;what are you going to do about it?” and was told that they would get me a replacement &quot;in 30 minutes&quot;. I asked to speak to the manager. I was told &quot;he is too busy&quot;. I asked what I had to do, &quot;come down and make a scene in front of the diners?&quot;. I was assured that I would be called back.  Today it is Monday. I am still waiting. I stopped off at Nazmins to ask for the manager at 6pm. I was told he would be in at 6.30pm. At 7.30pm my wife called and was told he was not working today. They probably knew that passing on my message was not a good idea.  It feels like your staff are basically avoiding their responsibility and hoping by lying to me again and again I will go away. Rest assured I have fought greater battles for less. I am a consumer who deals with his own clients with respect and integrity, realising I have a reputation to maintain. After a hard day I expect the same when I buy a service. I would have accepted an apology but this has been compounded and aside from my consumer right to at least a refund for what was not delivered I expected at least a decent response.   As stated, I will not expect to hear from you since your customer service is clearly lacking. I will never again use your restaurant and intend to ensure that the local and online community are in a position not to have their own evening ruined the way mine was because you believe it is fine to treat your clients in this manner.
-4	Usually it's enough to stand at the bar with a £20 note in your hand for the staff to recognise you as a customer waiting to be served. Not at The Blue Bell! After waiting 10 minutes for the female staff member to take the order from the lady in front of me (the fact the lady was sitting at a table with no number on it created total confusion and bafflement as to how her food might be transported to her) she just simply walked away and started talking to a friend on my side of the bar. I persevered knowing other staff members including as it transpired the manager had seen me standing at the bar waiting to be served. A barman came out of the kitchen looked at me waiting and went to collect glasses. At this point I was the only person at the bar and there were no staff behind the bar! Another barman returned behind the bar walked straight past me to the opposite end of the bar where a group of customers had just arrived and said &quot;Who's next?&quot;. Well it would be me considering before you returned to the bar I was the only one waiting to be served! I complained to the manager who offered to take our order. I declined. Been to the Blue Bell many times in the past and found the food and service excellent. The service on Sunday was abysmal, customers near me were complaining of wrong orders or non arrival of meals and I have subsequently been told the quality of food under the new management has fallen dramatically. I noticed the price of the Sunday roast we would have ordered has also increased considerably to £8! We left and went to The Ship Inn at Benton. Great food and service and only £6.45.
-4	 Lived in Farnham for 15 years and been to this place several times and only enjoyed great experiences. Today was quite different. Only one member of staff working and was clearly quite harassed and having a bad day. Barked at my wife when she enquired where she could park the kids' buggy, took 15 minutes to take our order and then shouted 'one at a time' whilst trying to order our drinks. Was generally quite hostile and did not seem bothered when we got up to leave. Our children were bewildered by his attitude. Sad to say we won't be back. Noticed him arguing with another couple about their bill as we were leaving. Odd to say the least. 
-4	I went to the restaraunt for my birthday with some family and i have to say this was the worst service I have ever received. There was loud music downstairs and when the waiter took our order he couldn't hear properly. I suggested TWICE that he write the order down as there were six of us. The waiter said he would remember and told us to order drinks and main meals so we did. 30 mins later the wiater bought out 3 meals. 10 mins or so later I asked where the other meals where and the waiter said there is no more food coming and that we only ordered 3 meals. I said that there is no way we ordered 3 meals as there are six of us and we all requested main meals, the very arrogant waiter said 'what do you want me to do about it' and walked off. I couldn't beleive what had happened. The manager came over and I explained what happened, at this point the waiter came over very aggressively and said that it wasn't his fault. He was threatening with his behaviour. The manager eventually bought out the other 3 meals about 30mins later. By this point my birthday meal had been compltetely ruined and the restaraunt were extremely arrogant and rude. This is easily the worst service I have EVER receieved and I advise you to save your money and visit one of the other restaraunts on Edgware Road.
-4	Unbelievable   There were 7 of us going for what we thought would be a pleasant Mother's Day breakfast. Their incompetence and rudeness ruined the experience:  - we had to wait nearly an hour for our food - 5 of the 7 orders were wrong  - when we politely asked for the orders to be corrected the waitress stomped off in a huff and came back to tell us we were wrong and stomped off again before we could respond   The food was ok to be fair and if you are looking for the Fawlty Towers experience then this might be the place for you - otherwise I'd suggest you stay away.
-4	Waited over a hour for the second course when it came the rump steak was a qusrter of an inch thick and could not cut, it was supposed to be medium to well. the replacement was almost as bad and half was left un chewable. My wifes chicken meal was cold but the sausages were solid burnt? Could not have been worse. Never again.
-4	 Bland burgers, soggy chips, slow service. And it took two months for the restaurant superviser to respond to my complaint - with a discourteous email. 
-4	 We came for a charity pub quiz that had been organised and reserved by a friend before hand.None of the pub staff appeared to know anything about it and not only initially ignored advices that the table area was reserved but also (having finally acknowledged that they had messed up on the reservation) continued to take food orders from tables that were not part of the pub quiz at the reserved tables!  Fortunately the quiz went ahead and was a success but no thanks to the staff.  
-4	Wow, what can we say?! We've felt pretty rotten all day after eating what only can be described as simply shocking food last night from this God awful place - I wish we'd seen the reviews first! It's tasteless, over-priced, they took an age in delivering and then never brought the prawn crackers we'd ordered... although going by the rest of what we ordered, it's probably best they did forget as I dread to think what they'd have been like! In short, don't order ANYTHING from this place and if you work for &quot;Bamboo Baboom&quot; I think it's time to find a different business before you poison someone!
-4	 Food was very nice paired with a wonderful wine list. Most of the staff was welcoming and helpful. Unfortunately a young sommelier was extremely dismissive, rude and simply was not up to the job at hand. While I understand the job of a sommelier very well, being myself a restaurant owner, if a customer happens to catch his attention with a request the least he can do is make sure that a server comes to the table. The sommelier in question only walked away after giving us what could only have been described as a look of contempt. He then proceeded to have a loud and heated conversation with other members of staff which added to our displeasure. This resulted in us having to stare at our empty main course plates for 15 minutes before someone cleared the table or offered us a dessert menu. The waiter that indeed came to help us after with the dessert menu was again very nice and helpful, however the night had been ruined at this point. It is incredible that someone in the service industry has this attitude towards customers. I probably wouldn't go back despite the rest of the experience being so nice. This young person (the young bespectacled sommelier) needs to rethink his career. 
-4	 I have been in here quite a lot but has never been as bad as it was today.  Ordered a cappuccino and a breakfast.  Young girl that served me spilt the coffee into the saucer, but did not remove it from saucer, and gave it to me anyway.  Breakfast was disgusting: Hash brown was overcooked and when i cut into it, it oozed fat out. the fried egg was hard and looked like it had been cooked in dirty oil, baked beans were cold.  Looking around tables were filthy with plate and cup marks on them, also numerous tables with plates still there from previous customers.  Needless to say will not be ging in there again. 
-4	 was told to wait at bar for 20mins, which turned in to nearly an hour and then just about to be seated and was informed that they hard run out of chicken and the ribs was another 15mins wait !! so we walked out  surly they could see we was waiting and new that they were running out and could have asked us if we was expecting chicken and given us an opportunity to go some where else very poor management in my opinion !!!! 
-4	 We booked for 30th November at 7.30pm and gave our choice of menu plus a deposit during October. Having arrived at 7.20 , most of the starters arrived half an hour later., followed by 2 of them that had to be re made because of a mishap in the kitchen.We then waited until 8.50 for the main course. (Not all of us had had starters so by then we were starving!! ) The duck was under cooked, the veg was cold, one dish didn't have potatoes on it and the fish was very small. Then came the final disaster. Puddings. We had ordered 4 meringue roulades. The waiter appeared and informed us that they only had 3 but that they were getting a delivery the next day!!!!! Would someone choose something else!! How can a caterer with over a months notice run out of the correct items??!! We will not be returning nor recommending it. 
-4	 Absolutely disgraceful is the only way I can describe the service we received when trying to use a living social voucher. The app clearly stated we could redeem a smartphone voucher yet this was refused. The waitress was off hand, rude and lacked people skills. I will never return here unless I get an adequate apology and compensation, I will tell everyone I know not to come here and will complain to living social and recommend they be barred from offering any deals ever again. Ruined my night out with a good friend. 
-4	 We booked this restaurant for a party of 18 on New Years eve. Several members of our party had travelled from Canterbury to be with us for the evening. Another member of our party was nine months pregnant therefore we opted for an earlier booking of 7.30pm as can often feel poorly when eating later - so this was the prefect timing. However, the starters did not arrive until 9.45pm and one had been forgotton totally despite only haalf of the party having starters (9 starters approx). Furthermore the table was not cleared and there was no sight of the main courses arriving for a further 45 minutes until we promoted them to bring some cutlery and plates. As you can imagine by this point we were all becoming quite annoyed. At no point did any of the staff apologise for the wait but eventually brought some of the food out and greeted us with the phrase 'Do you want the food or not, its getting cold?' he began putting it on the table and we discovered that it was already cold! At which point we all decided that New years eve was runied and we promptly left the restaurant - still yet to recieve any apology or explanation from the staff.  I would never return to or recommend this restaurant to anyone - a total disgrace!!!! 
-4	 Having walked 5 miles to the plough changed our shoes and arrived at 1.50 we were turned away after being told they had had a quiet lunch time and the kitchen was closed. So we then drove 10 miles to the Cherry Tree and had an excellent meaL 
-4	 Just left the restaurant an hour ago. I was expecting to go as it was recomended from a lot friends and I was looking forward to try. I been in Bem Brasil and everytime I been there I loved it. Why that one would be diferent? We were trying the restaurant as I booked for my graduation. I deceided to go before my graduation to give it a chance before bring my family and friends for my graduation in July.... No anymore. The portugese waitress was very nice. My friend ordered vegetarian option and took 35 min to come to the table. The guy who was serving the food stoped in my table twice, on the other tables was meat all the time. I told Cristina the host and she went to tell him. He came with some meat and never saw him again.  I just deceide order coffee and leave. When I told Cristina I want to cancel the reservation for July she judt smiled and didnt care at all.  Very disapointed. I will never come back or revomend to my family&friends sorry. 
-4	 Have enjoyed several meals at Ashiana but this evening had the worst ever. Took over half an hour to deliver poppadoms (in a half empty restaurant), starter when that eventually arrived was OK but nothing special. The mains was inedible - I like spicy food but the chef clearly thought that spice was more important than flavour. This was by a long way the worst Indian meal I have ever had and I certainly won't be back and would not recommend Ashiana to anyone. 
-4	 Ordered a battered cod with chips. The young waitress obviously has no training in hospitality or customer realtions as she was more interested in playing on her phone more than taking our order. When the food arrived the fish was oozing with greese and hardly any fish compaired to batter. The chips were terrible and cold and served on a dirty plate. We usually leave a tip but all we left this time was the food. Never again will i visit. 
-4	 We booked this restaurant for our Sons birthday at 8.00 on a Saturday. On arrival we were ushered to our table then left without a waiter to order drinks for at least 15mins finally when we managed to gain attention to the very poor mannered waiter he left us for a further 15mins before he returned to take our order, We received our meal at 9:30 by another bad mannered waiter. The poppadoms were stale! my order was a Chicken Masala it had so much food colouring it was bright red that aside it was not of a good standard at all and lacking any quality for this dish. I have to say the staff are not friendly and have zero table manners for their customers in fact bordering on ignorant! the wait for the meal was unacceptable and the overall experience was terrible i would never recommend this restaurant! 
-4	 Like the review below, when into the restaurant as it was cold and was offered 25% off, shown a picture of Peter Jones smiling outside of it and given a round of free drinks (although the beers were a half pint which was a bit disappointing when you were given a pint or bottle of wine in most other restaurants.) Once inside the waiters seemed oblivious to the fact that customers were waiting to order and when they did come over their general attitude towards customers was one of general distain. When they did bring our food over it was the wrong order and when the correct one came they may as well of threw it at us. We then pointed out that we were missing a rice and this was met with more petulant looks from the waiter and by this point we dared not point out the fact that the chicken tikka was a korma with a dash of red colouring and the balti was as hot as a madras. We have visiting a lot of curry houses over the years and I would rate this as one of the poorest. Avoid at all costs as it is overly priced and gives off the feeling from the moment that you walk in the door that it doesn't need or indeed want your business. 
-4	Dark table in draughty corner, since they don't bother changing the light bulbs I guess shouldn't be surprised they haven't stuck a bit of filler in the hole in the wall, or cleaned the drink machine. When you can bend breadsticks without breaking them something is very wrong. Pizza was great, as it always is in this chain, just the place sucks so bad, the absolute absence of effort is everywhere to see, nowhere more so than in the conduct of the waiting staff. Perhaps the lack of working light bulbs meant she just couldn't see us, more likely she just didn't care that she was serving tables arriving 15 minutes after us first. I could rant all day, what an awful place, if only I could actually get the damn bill, pay and get out of here.
-4	Me and my partner decide to go to the Plug & Feathers for a nice meal but it did not plan out that way. As we arrived we ordered drinks from the bar and then proceeded to find our selves a seat, after sitting down and being ready to order we sat there for a further 20 minutes before a very rude and abrupt ginger waitress with glasses finally decided to come over and take our order after staring at us for the past 5 minutes. she then took our order in a manor which i can say i have never been spoke to in my life in a restaurant it seems that this particular waitress has never heard of customer service as when she was taking our order we asked her what burger she would recommend and she replied rudely and very disrespectfully with &quot;I'm a vegetarian i don't eat burgers!&quot; which i then replied &quot;Ok, but which would you recommend&quot; she then replied &quot;I just told you I'm a vegetarian!&quot; i couldn't believe my ears. So i just proceeded and ordered any of the ones on choice, after spending a further 20 minutes - 30 minutes waiting for our food after we heard the bell ring 4 times and no member of staff bothered to check if anyones orders where ready, we proceeded to watch the ginger girl who had served us talk to other customers and staff in the same manor as which she had spoken to us in, now I'm no expert and i don't work in a restaurant but i am positive that this manor isn't seen as positive and customer friendly. after finally getting our meals which were both very dry and luke-warm from sitting under a light for the past 20 minutes or so. after we finished our meals we proceeded to go to the bar to pay for our meals when our visit just keeps getting better. Once going to the bar we was served by a lady who seemed to be management which also had just about as much customer service as the ginger girl, when i was paying for our meals i felt as if i was something that she had found on the bottom of her shoe i can truly say i have never once experienced anything like this and i will not be returning and telling friends and family not to aswell. other than the bad customer service skills of members of staff the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and can really achieve but they desperately need to have a strong word with both staff and management.
-4	We had the fish and chips. The worst I have had in my life. Chips just a soggy oily mess. The fish looked good but exploded when prodded with my fork to an empty shell of nothing. An elderly foreign couple on a table near us had the same. God knows what they thought of our English fish n chips. However the barmaid was really nice.
-4	Came to the Aagrah after having read the reviews. We weren't disappointed. Food and service was excellent. We would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant and are contemplating going again...
-4	 We were in Brigg on a short business trip and thought we'd visit China Royal for a nice Chinese. What were wasn't expecting was to encounter one of the rudest and unhelpful members of staff I have ever encountered! Upon arrival we were quickly sat at a bench seat in reception with a menu shoved in our hands, the restaurant was empty and it felt a little strange looking at a menu without being seated at a table! To cut a long story short, we ended up leaving the restaurant and settling our drink bill without ordering any food due to the waiter having quite possibly the worst interpersonal skills I have ever encountered. My advice would be to stay well clear of the China Royal. Luckily we found a fantastic restaurant just around the corner, so it worked out great in the end. 
-4	 Went here as it was listed in 'Spotted By Locals' guide. There's not much to say other than the interior, food and service were all disappointing. I was surprised by how cheap the menu was and felt it justified the very greasy food. The calamari and mushroom starter were dripping, and the plaice was inedible with a strong fishy smell. The minute lamb was the pick of the bunch. The interior was like a sauna, the restaurant staff tried to give my partner the wrong bill and didn't even acknowledge him with any manners. I would avoid this place. There's so many other good restaurants in the vicinity. 
-4	 i would like to have titled this awful birthday meal but that would not do it justice...bad from start to finish and beyond. Staff did not know the menu, food sent back, rude manager. The loos were clean though...shame that is the only nice thing i can say... 
-4	 Complimentary spicy chicken bites were raw, blood near the bone and very chewy. Scallop starter was very much over done which you wouldn't expect when paying a premium price. Main course of fish pie was clearly re-heated in the microwave due to hot and cold spots during eating, lamb shank was cold and again obviously re-heated and then sauce added after, so no flavour in the lamb. We had high expectations of this pub- restaurant but was deeply disappointed, on top of that an inflated price tag of £70 for the food we half ate, not impressed what so ever! 
-4	 My 5 year old daughter likes their chicken nuggets so popped in for a &quot;treat&quot;. I went for the chicken sandwich with BBQ sauce. Spent the next 48 hours throwing up. For legal reasons I can't say it was definitely the chicken sandwich which caused this but to be on the safe side I won't be eating there ever again. 
-4	 Gave this restaurant a second chance after previously having a below standard carvery but things still same. Dry vegetables because left uncovered,the only edible part of the meal was the meat and Yorkshire. Raised issue with chef and got a blank expression so got management to deal with issue and ended up with full refund for food and a free sweet which was great. 
-4	 Really amazing foods and beautiful view of London. But I had the worst treatment at the door when the security accused me of being drunk just because I was laughing with my friends in the queue. I had never been accused of anything in anywhere else I've ever attended. Completely different treatment at Zuma. 
-4	 Simply very poor management and staff that said it all for us!!! As we are local folk i thought it would be nice to come and see the live music and have a glass.... thats went it went all wrong, my partner requested a white wine ....only to be told they had run out of glasses..!!!!what a joke of a place!!! it may be they had a large sitting but you dont just run out!!! you clear tables quickly .... we did get a glass a few minutes later but it did spoil the first few minutes ..... This place is nice inside and lots of money has been spent.... they need as a company with lots of outlets to look at the staff and kick some out... or shut it down and start again ... sorry the new mill learn quick or you wont be there in 2 years?? better still go and visit Bills in Taunton WHO do deliver outstanding service every time . 
-4	 Visited in early Dec to celebrate parents 75th birthday. Problems with food and Bill, manager contacted my wife after meal to state next time we visited we would have complimentary bottle of wine. Booked for wedding anniversary after emailing manager, guess what NO COMPLMENTARY WINE. 
-4	So we were in Leominster, a pretty town on the borders, one Sunday evening, in search of food. &quot;I'm dying for a pizza&quot;, utters my daughter's friend; and by so doing drew us into the maelstrom of events culminating in this review.  The one review for Ristorante Milano was favourable, and so we entered. We sat down, and the owner brought the menus. Pizza was on the menu, and the owner pointed to the several certificates and pages stuck on the wall advertising his status as a champion pizza chef.  So it seemed we had hit oil! Here in Leominster, a champion pizza chef.  Without any hesitation we ordered. Three pizzas and a mixed salad. The owner was jovial. &quot;Can you make pizza?&quot;, he asked. We said that we could. He appeared pleased. Maybe we were the pizza fanatics that the town had hitherto lacked, come for the pizza mirabilis.  Along came the mixed salad. Generously proportioned and attractively arranged. Slightly bland, but nothing to moan about. Soon forks were happily competing for bits of radicchio, red onion and cucumber.  But then along came the pizzas.  My heart sunk. Sunk faster than a Mafia hit victim, feet encased in concrete, the last bubbles of life rising up through the dark water.  For what I saw was not the work of an artisanal pizza champion, but something that had lately been on a production line. The base was made of a spongy cake-like substance rather than any sort of proper dough. The topping was homogeneous, with a cheese coating extending to the edge of the base, in the hope perhaps of hiding it from view.  My pizza was billed as a Pizza Zingara, and was to be surmounted with meatballs and sausage. It was. But not polpette bursting with flavour and Italian salsicce; no. The meatballs defied description, and the sausage had that transport caff banger taste and texture.  The children appeared to enjoy theirs to an extent, but then they eat stuff from chain restaurants. These were not cheap pizzas. Mine was over £10.  I decided against making a fuss. The children ordered and ate tiramisu and I had a coffee, all too aware that the gunky mixture I had just consumed would have unpleasant gaseous gastric consequences over the hours to come.  As he brought the tiramisu, the owner let it slip that he had been short-listed for a French cooking competition. Unless he was just making all this stuff up, the owner can cook. So why didn't he?  I paid the bill and we left. I would how that the owner reads this and abandons whatever path of mediocrity he is currently following. Surely there are enough people in Leominster who like proper pizza to make it worth while for him to use the skills he says he had to good advantage. Or if not, he should not pretend that this is what he is doing.  He gets one star for the salad.
-4	 The spotted cow has been closed for some weeks now. I live nearby and will review again if it re-opens. Meanwhile you will need to find an alternative. 
-4	 I've never written a review about the Tatton Arms before... Not really sure why as we've always been really happy with the service, food, atmosphere of this lovely pub. We expected our visit today to be no different...  We booked a table the day before for approximately 6 o'clock. We arrived shortly before, and were seated promptly. Drinks orders were placed, and brought to the table all within 5 minutes. We were told that our food order would be taken in a few minutes. 20 minutes later, our food order was finally taken (it was busy and we accept that the delay was due to this). We were then approached to advise our meal choice was not available as they had sold out. We were therefore asked to pick something else, not a problem these things happen.  We picked and placed our order. 40 minutes passed, and our food arrived, as before as food is freshly cooked and the pub busy we did expect a wait. We finished our meal, and heard other tables being served Sunday lunches. We were confused, as we'd been told there were none left... We asked a waitress who said they'd ordered a lunch but had been sat outside having a drink... By this point it had been an hour since we'd placed our order and couldn't understand how meals for people who had ordered before us were coming out after we'd finished?  We ordered a desert, and did mention our concerns to the waitress, who did apologise, but said there was nothing she could really do about it, and would ask Karen (we assume the landlady), to come over and speak to us. After seeing a delegation deciding who would come and speak to us, it was left to a regular face to come over. We explained our concerns, and advised how upset we were, (all we expected was to be told that they'd sold out and that some people had pre-ordered and not to panic if what we wanted was being served after we'd finished). The lady said she'd get Karen over...  ... Karen was more bothered about sweeping the floor, we sat for about 5 minutes watching her, before deciding to leave.   What is the real shocker, is that Karen never even acknowledged us, and we were made to feel as though we were the bad guys... Over the last 18 months we have spent considerably here, but sadly no more. There are lots of pubs that close, and usually it's because of poor management and customer service... I thought in these times landlords had pulled their socks up, sadly not the case here.   
-4	 We visited this pub on Saturday night, to meet up with family. We booked after reading the good reviews on tripadvisor. We booked the table on Thursday night, and we were asked whether we wanted steak as you had to order them in advance, which we thought was quirky but accepted that it was a small village pub. We ordered a couple of steaks and looked forward to arriving on the Saturday evening.   We booked the table for 7pm and arrived at about 6.15pm and had a drink as we waited for the other couple to arrive. The pub clearly welcomes a lot of regulars from the local area and first impressions were good. The couple we were meeting were running late due to taxi trouble and we informed the man serving us (who we presume is the landlord) that we may be a few minutes late. He was more than accommodating about this and said he had another table that he was currently busy serving and it worked out well that we were running late. When the couple we were meeting arrived at about 7.10pm we were keen to sit down and look over some menus and told the staff this. We were told we were to order our meals at the bar when and then we would be seated when the meal was nearly ready. We asked for a menu, which wasn't provided until I got up and waited as the man said 'just give me a minute'. We eventually got menus and ordered at the bar. We waited for a while longer, then we're told we'd have to move from our seats and go through to the table as the area needed to be cleared for the live music act. We then waited at the table, with no drinks service, no cutlery or condiments at the table for about an hour and a half. We got our meals at 9.30pm. There were only 3 other tables in the restaurant area at the time. The food was generally good, one person in our party requested that their gammon was well cooked and this was not the case. The steaks were nice, portions big. Shame that by the time our meals arrived, we had lost our appetites. When we finished our meals, our plates sat in front of us for another hour, before we eventually moved them to a table next to us ourselves as we couldn't look at them any longer.   As the whole meal ran so late, we requested that the landlord cancel a taxi he had kindly booked for us earlier, so we could book a later taxi. The landlord was quite rude as we apologised for the inconvenience, stating loudly that it was an inconvenience.  We are not difficult customers and would very rarely leave a review of this nature. However, this pub could be so nice if there were only more staff and a few lessons need to be learnt regarding customer service. Myself and my partner both spent many years working in the hospitality and restaurant trade and we are aware that staffing can be an issue during busy periods, but rudeness and poor customer relations and communication cannot be excused. With such good reviews on trip advisor, the landlord needs to make the most of it and expect that there will be busy times. We felt like an inconvenience all night. We are fortunate to live in a small village and have a lovely pub opposite our home, the staff at this pub could do with paying the staff there a visit and pick up a few hints and tips!  We will be meeting our family in the area more regularly over the coming months and we certainly will not be visiting this pub again. 
-4	 Been visiting this pub for many years, since the new management we will not be returning. Rude young women, claims to be the new manager & staff with bright red hair walking around in hoodies. 
-4	 These guys need to go outside and take a look at their own signage. Pizza is not complicated and Express means fast. While you are out there, take a look next door at the Theatre and ask why the majority of your customers are there !  For our party, they delivered on none of their signage. Over 50 minutes wait for five simple orders is a disgrace. The food never arrived and neither did the explanation we politely requested. We paid for our overpriced drinks and left.  I've been to plenty of other Pizza Expresses and the food is good. This restaurant is just ill equipped to handle their location.  Please get a team in that can handle the pace. 
-4	Only the ignorant could give McD's a higher rating! Do their customers realise how much fruit or veg they could buy with the money they spend in these places?
-4	 wooo were to start... we booked in for a meal on saturday feb 23 2012,, a party of 8.. at 8pm,, we arrived about 7.50 and was seated at our table,, it took the 'waitress' 15 mins b4 she took our drink order, i asked for a bottle of stella,( which was on the menu) 'we dont have, ok a bulmers. ( again on the menu) we dont have..so i settled 4 a mythos, greek lager which is priced way more than either of these other 2 drinks....which was warm... a we asked for a bottle of rose,, they only had white, or red.. a friend ordered a pino grigio white,, when the drinks finally arrived the pino grigio was watered down and flat..we told the 'waitress' ( 2 dis interested girls 21-23) her reply was ' its wine isnt it' but she changed it 4 a beer... so... we finally placed our starter order,, 1 warm meze plater, 2 cold mezze platters, and 2 side orders of prawns..about 840 we placed this order..time ticking by and by and after a hour none of our starters hadnt arrived we asked the waitress she replied this is our busy time.. before we arrived there was about 10-14 people in the place.. there was a group of 4 sat behind us who said they had been waiting for 1hour 20 for there starter and that if it wasnt here in the next 10 mins they were leaving... they did leave by the way!! so our staters were rushed out the warm platter had meatballs in it which were bone cold..literally frozen inside with a semi warm sauce poured over them... to thisp oint we were all starving and a little peeved off... we said to the waitress whats the delay her reply again was were busy tonite...we counted 145 ppl inside and told her this...she said ye thats busy 4 us!!! ina nut shell never ever under any circumstances eat here!!!! then the waitress said our delay was because we shudda called ahead and placed our order b4 hand hahahah this is a sit down restaruant not some chinese takeaway absolute piles this place AVOID!!!!! 
-4	I emailed the restaurant before making my booking for my girlfriend and I and got the following response &quot; apart from pasta and bread all the rest of our menu can be gluten free as long as you informour waiter we will take away the basting&quot;. I thought this was great until we got to the restaurant and received a different story from the waiter, none of the sauces were available for the starters as they were mixed in with bastings, most of the steak sauces were unavailable along with the mash, we ended up having to order a cheeseburger with no bun and some chips, we asked if we could have bacon and pineaple with the burger instead of the bun and still got charged for it.......after sending an email to high-light our issues I got a call from the restaurant apologising for the mix up, they then offered a free meal for 1 person, i thought this was a joke at first, if I ran a restaurant and ruined the evening for 2 people I wouldnt insult them by offering a meal for 1.....It is an impressive looking restaurant but just not very proffessionally managed......I wouldnt recommend it if you have any special dietary requirements
-4	 's returned from a night at roosters, I finished work and fancied going out to have a nice meal.  Chose Morley Hayes as have been there before.  We were told a 40min wait which is a time but we thought ok.  An hour later no food so I asked and I was told 2 min it's next order out..... I was lied too, I watched 4 more orders go out and not ours.  4 more people went up to complain and they were told the same.  I waited another 15 min and still no food!!  This was now 21:25! Absolutely  Ridiculous.. So I complained again only to be told &quot; well you were told an hour wait&quot; to which I said no 40min....  When the food finally came it wasn't great I had a dry burger, my wife had a very poor stew and Yorkshire pudding.   Not what you want with hard earned money....   The weather has cheered us all up and we are let down by people like this lying to us!!   Avoid and go else where....   In response to the manager:   When we arrived the restaurant wasn't near full there were plenty of free tables, if your told 40min wait you expect 40min plus 10min not plus 35min... Lie 1!  I wasn't refunded at all for any meal as you have stated...  Lie2!  If you can't handle food orders I suggest you rethink your business plan. 
-4	Staying for the weekend with my parents we thought we'd try out a local restaurant rather than cook. Stupidly we decided to ignore the slightly dodgy reviews on here as we fancied thai... How wrong could we have been. Swimming in grease, unidentifiable meat, no flavour, over cooked and giving the distinct impression that whoever was cooking had never eaten thai or in fact even been told they worked at a thai restaurant. Absolutely revolting and very expensive to boot.
-4	This was my fourth time here. The food is more pricey than most pubs, and previously I hadn't minded because the quality had been mostly good and the venue has a great play area for kids.  This time around, I found the service was appalling. The restaurant (and outside dining area) was not full - probably normal for a sunny bank holiday. Certainly nowhere near at capacity.  We had to wait 1/2 hour before we could order, and our food took 1.5 hours. Even then, it arrived in dribs and drabs. When ordering an additional drink, it took 45 minutes to arrive, and we had to ask for it 3 times. The food itself was average at best. To be honest, I've had much better for much cheaper. I'm very understanding when a restaurant is busy and service takes a little longer, but this was just too much! When we complained to the manager he gave a shrug and did apologise, but it was clear he didn't really care. It's a shame when a place that has built a good reputation for food and service goes downhill and takes its customers for granted. I won't be going back.
-4	 I visited this restaurant several weeks ago and had a chicken Madras, perfectly spiced which induced a mild to medium sweat.   However, on returning with a work colleague and not wanting to appear too sweaty, I chose a lamb Rogan Josh. As everyone knows, a Rogan Josh is a medium strength curry. Or so I thought. The curry served to me was like a meat stew totally devoid of heat. I asked for some chills to put on my meal, but the waiter removed my plate, bringing it back some time later. The only thing that had changed was the addition of more tomatoes and the teeniest amount of heat, by no means medium and not even mild. When you visit this restaurant make sure you tell the staff exactly how you'd like your curry served. 
-4	 Just really spoiled a great family day, bad service at its worst. We made the so called mistake of complaining and then had to put up with pure ignorance. From a whitbread company I'm surprised. 
-4	 Pre-booked Christmas lunch for a party of four, when the food 'eventually' arrived it was simply not fit for human consumption, Manager obliged to refund money and waffled on about this being the first time anyone had complained! Suggest you read your reviews sunshine, better still get some staff that know what they are doing, appalling service and overpriced miserable portions-avoid!! 
-4	 Rating based on food, the drinks and atmosphere were fine.  Bland potato and pea/ carrot based burger with no flavour, a bit like you got from a chip shop in the early 90s. No excuse for poor veggie burger options these days. 
-4	 Visited Sunday 24th July in group including two children under 4. Called ahead to book, but could not book table outside. We arrived 1ish, bought drinks and asked for some menus. We went to order food shortly after and they announced no more food orders for an hour due to being too busy with a large reservation.   Despite half our table ordering just before the announcement, the manager refused to take seperate order for other half of table. Were given the option of all waiting, eat seperate or refund. Took the refund and won't be returning. Shame. Had they communicated the delay earlier, the disappointment could have been avoided. Not even an apology was given. 
-4	 Awful chicken katsu, I don't think ingredients were good, in fact I got stomach ache in the evening. Scarce service. In two words: &quot;Never more&quot;. 
-4	 We booked a table for thirteen people on Sunday 27th December. On arrival we were one down due to illness of one of our party. The room that we had our table in was drab with no Christmas decoration at all. We were immediately told we would have to pay for the one missing person and also NOT allowed to take home that meal(a salad) as that was their policy. Additionally we had to order puddings prior to starting the main meal(as if you know what or even if you want a pudding before starting a main meal). I complained to the general manager who insisted I could not take away the paid for extra meal without signing a waiver and he had nothing we could take it away anyway. This would have been interesting as one of our party is a solicitor, but in the end they relented and gave us a dated plastic box(after much arguing). The food was very average, quite oily and generally lacked taste. Avoid this hotel if you want good food and customer service. We had neither. One plus point was the waitress who did her best under poor management direction. 
-4	 Me and my family went out for a meal and all I can say was it was waste of time and money the staff are rude the food was horrible if I was anyone reading this I would never go to this pub ever. The lady behind the bar with the glasses is the most rudest person I have met in my life. If that's how you treat your customers I think you're in the wrong job 
-4	 Ordered online - nice & easy.  Went to collect - smelt like bad drain problems outside - urrrgh.  Got food home - smelt & tasted like the bad drains. Far too much salt in the hot & sour soup (if I'd have eaten in I would have sent it back). Far too much something-which-tasted-very-nasty in the kung po chicken (+ 1/2 pint of soy salt).  Avoid unless you like toilet smells and salt. 
-4	 I wrote a review for The Chaser on the Opentable website (which we used to book a table) and was annoyed that my poor review was swallowed up on the site because the default setting for reviews is for 'Highest Review' and not 'Newest'. So I am repeating it here: I had not been to The Chaser for some years as I considered it to be pricey for pub food and it was a bit plain inside. However, I chose to give it another go. This time I found it to be more cosy but unfortunately the food was disappointing. I don't want to spend more than about £50 for two, including drinks and the tip, because going out for a meal four times a month would mean spending about £200 per payday anyway. We decided to have beer-battered cod and chips and a desert after our initial drinks. We love fish and chips, but the chips we had at The Chaser were not fresh - an essential requirement for such a meal, in my view. They tasted like they were one or more day old previously cooked potatoes (leftovers that had been baked or boiled?) that had been chipped and then deep fried. I think it is so important to make sure that food is prepared to a high standard, as that is what would make me want to go back again, or not. So, not. 
-4	 I've been to this restaurant for the first time few weeks back. Wish I didn't. The manager who was very grumpy and was very rude!! We asked him for some ice to which he replied that they don't do it in a funny way. Anyways when asked a waiter he informed us that they do infact have ice. This particular waiter was very friendly with efficient service. He looked after us and when we enquired about the management he did appologise and informed us that the owner is away on holiday and the ''rude manager'' infact is just covering. The starters were rubbish.. dry kebabs. The mains were very nice. 
-4	 After waiting almost 2 hours and getting fobbed off 3 times on the phone. The delivery driver turned up eventually and when my son asked if any discount was in order, the driver (bald with glasses) tried to force entry and attack my son while shouting expletives. He than sped off before i could get to him. BE WARNED! 
-4	 Heard great things about this restaurant...........sadly they don't appear interested in taking bookings as for the last 2 hours I have been phoning them to try to book a group of 10 people in and no one wants to answer the telephone number provided on their website. 
-4	 My wife and I were taken here by our friends for lunch on Thursday 28th July. We arrived at 12:30 and bought drinks at the bar and were showed to a table for lunch. We ordered our four lunch choices at 12:40. The pub was reasonably busy, but not every table was taken and there seemed to be enough staff available. At 13:40 we still hadn't had our lunches and we asked a waitress what the delay was and informed her that we had already waited 60 minutes. She informed us that there was around a 45 minute wait for orders. We were not informed when we ordered that there would be any delay plus the waitress seemed to have missed the fact that we had already waited for 60 minutes. We were told that our food would be another 5 to 10 minutes. After waiting for 70 minutes in total from ordering our lunches we then saw two tables who had only been sitting for 15 minutes being served with their food. At this point we lost patience and left, never to return. 
-4	 Had to wait for 30 minutes for food as our order was given to another table. Food was very bland.  For the same price I would recommend the Lock Keeper in Keynsham. Much better service and the food is delicious, unlike Chequers the rip off. 
-4	 Table booked for 7.30pm - sat down at 8.20pm. One hour and 20 minutes from starter to second course, then they asked if we had had our starter as they could not remember ! Food hot plates went cold before the food arrived. Requested water but they asked us to drink it from wine glasses as they could not find correct glasses. Still eating main course at 10 o clock. No explanation or apologies offered.  I have sent a letter, 2 emails, telephoned them and contacted them via their website but they have totally ignored me. No reply or acknowledgement. They quite clearly have a policy of WE HAVE GOT YOUR MONEY SO NOW WE DON'T CARE. Beware any future customers. 
-4	 Reserved a table for four a month in advance for 7.30pm reconfirmed the night before. We arrived at 7.00pm and asked for  drinks and the menu. To be short the service was awful, there was none.  On asking staff what was happening we were told that an important resident had unexpectedly arrived with guests and our table had been given to them. On complaining the manager was rude, every table was now taken and we finally sat down at 9.00pm receiving the canapés, bread and starters all at the same time. The service was still non-existent the worst ever we have experienced. We complained again more strongly and finally received an apology and an offer of free wine, the main course, desert and coffee finally arrived  and we finished eating after 11.00pm in a virtually empty restaurant. A ruined evening with an incompetent new manager unhappy staff. Hope you do not receive the same dire treatment. There are other good food Inns in this delightful part of Yorkshire.  
-4	 Ok due to an overnight stay I unfortunately decided to eat here.Now very few places can get pate and toast wrong but this place managed that having pre buttered the toast and then sending toast out stone cold with butter in a dish as well!!! Main of T-bone steak steak supposedly medium (very bloody a decent vet would have got it moving again).Cold chips peas and onion rings. Girl behind the bar severed with a snarl that quite frankly in any other service industry would not be accepted. This is very probably the worst dining experience that I have ever encountered makes Fawlty Towers look efficient. Won't be back even when hell freezes over!!!!!! 
-4	 I use to come to this restaurant quite a lot , But in the last few months the food quality has really gone down hill. I don't know if they have changed chefs but the food isn't the same. Will I be back again I don't think so. 
-4	 We were visiting Willington and booked a table for Saturday night. The food was OK, if pricey, but the service was truly awful. We ordered a round of drinks whilst we looked at the menu. The drinks arrived and we asked for a jug of tap water. 15 minutes later, no water. We asked again, and eventually got the water and our starters. As I, say the food was OK but not exceptional.  Then the main course arrived, but the starter plates had not been cleared away. The waitress just pushed things around the table and plonked the main course down in front of us. We asked if she could clear the other plates. &quot;Oh yeah, I'll do that&quot;. We asked for another round of drinks. These were completely forgotten about and eventually I had to ask again.   The waiting staff seemed to be having a reunion around the bar and were taking little interest in the comfort of the diners.   Indeed, I watched in amazement as food was served to a couple on the table next to us. A plate of fish and chips was thrown onto the table scattering the chips off the plate onto the table. The waitress just said &quot;Enjoy your meal&quot; and walked off! The couple just looked at each other!   By this time we could see our second round of drinks were sitting on a tray on the bar. The waiting staff (still around the bar) were looking at it and shrugging shoulders. They had no idea who it was for. I put them out of their misery.  This was truly a night to remember - for all the wrong reasons. The food average, but not exceptional and rather pricey. The service - well - it was amateur night at The Dragon. 
-4	I take clients out to lunch all the time, and to save time I opted to go here as it was local. However after 45 mins the client and I left hungry and disappointed. Having ordered the steak lunch for each of us which is the most expensive offering on the menu and judging by the rest of the menu one of the easiest to cook, I was told that they lost our order when I enquired as to where our food was. A promise of 10 mins to turn around the order was not met even though I had explained I was with a client and we had a limited amount of time for lunch. They had not even started to cook it in the 10 mins prior. We both left hungry after nearly 45 mins which is less than ideal and a little embarrassing. Considering the amount of places to eat locally I will be making other choices in the future regardless on how good the coffee is.
-4	 Use this pub twice a year when attending NEC exhibitions.  On the positive side a great selection of well priced drinks.  Can't believe how they constantly manage to employ such awful staff!! Meeting colleagues here tonight and already witnessed several customers walk out because of lack of service/ bad service.  They are more interested in chatting to each other and when you eventually get served there is no eye contact or please and thank you's. 
-4	Croma have a bizarre booking policy: you can only book a table of four people or more. Why? If you have friends or colleagues and want to take them out then you can't take the risk at busy times that they will have no space and therefore you'll all go hungry.   WAKE UP CROMA! There are other restaurants who will gladly accept my booking. And you'll lose out now and in the future. You only make pizzas after all, despite your pretentiousness...
-4	 Went to The Village inn a few weeks back and won't be returning. The minute we walked in I just knew it was going to be one of them days. A fair few people where waiting at the bar with one bloke serving while other staff seemed to be trying to look busy but not actually doing anything. Food arrived and my steak that I asked to be cooked rare turned up cremated, I can understand a chef getting a steak order a little bit over or under but this was a joke, I had to find a waitress to ask about the situation and once I did she just grabbed the plate and said &quot;better get you another then&quot;. So a nice meal out turns into me watching the Mrs eat her dinner for 15 minutes whilst waiting for mine. In fairness when the steak turned up it wasn't to bad but the rest of the food on the plate was not exactly nice, anybody would think it was my last plate of food reheated. This place has joined the avoid list. 
-4	 Could be good, but isn't. The decor needs to be adjusted a little to make it more appealing. The food needs to use more fresh Thai vegetables and herbs. The wait, however...when a restaurant is not full, it's reasonable to expect food (starters, for example...) in less than an hour or hour-and-a-half. I've seen table after table pay for their drinks and walk out. Not acceptable. Thai food doesn't even take that long to cook.  Great to have a local Thai restaurant, but the quality of the food needs to improve, the service and the décor. A lot. 
-4	 I rang to book a table on tastecard but they said they stopped doing it. If they can't be bothered to make sure the information on their restaurant up to date on the tastecard website then I can't be bothered visiting them. They've wasted my time! 
-4	 We booked for 7pm and arrived on time (having seen the previous trip advisor reviews!!) The place was fairly busy but we were prepared for a relaxed evening. We were asked about drinks and the wine list was very short and of poor quality choices. The best red was a basic Chianti which we ordered, but a few minutes later we were told it was not available! We then ordered a Valpol and our foodat the same time, about 10 past 7pm. The wine was bland and a poor version. We then saw 6 bottles of a wine not on the wine list a montipulciano da'bruzzo and asked if I could have that instead and after a palaver was told yes, tried it, agreed it, and there it sat on the wrong side of the counter for an hour!!! Our starters hadn't come. We ordered a bottle of water, that didn't come and after more than an hour we got up to leave. We were charged for the whole of the1/3rd bottle of valpolicella consumed. Incredibly bad service, frankly the worst we have ever experienced. The waiter who had &quot;served&quot; us all evening asked &quot;who took your order?&quot; he didn't even remember it was him!! There seemed to be zero customer awareness.The manager/owner? offered us a free meal next time we come, but it left such a bad feeling we will never go back there! Although we have put terrible in the food rating we did not get to taste anything but the bread sticks! 
-4	 I popped into the Lister Arms for a quick bite to eat after a long shift at work, Big mistake. Only one member of the team was on the bar at this point to serve and a few of us waiting. After being able to order another 45 minutes passed until receiving my meal, my quick bite was becoming more like a marathon. feeling tired and now a little angry I finished as quick as possible and left. I have enclosed some pictures of the table next to mine which looked like it was a holding area for the pot wash, it was added to but not removed for the whole of my visit, this table is most defentley in few of the main entrance and would not make for a lasting first memory of your Pub. 
-4	 Used a Groupon Voucher and took two friends who were paying full price. Starters took ages and weren’t bad. Main course Lamb Tagine scraps of meat and sickly sweet, came with anaemic veg with all the flavour boiled away, steaks accompanied by one mushroom and half a tomato covered in Balsamic Vinegar so that was all you could taste. Sweets were worst; Belgian Waffles were stale, cold and resembled corrugated cardboard in texture and taste. When we complained they wanted to knock 10% off, not much good when you have paid up front for a Groupon Voucher. Serious attitude problem with manager, very poor customer relations and became rude and very irate at the fact that we had the temerity to complain and would not do any more. Paid and left but when two of party went back in to get manager’s name they found him, kitchen staff and waitresses having a real good laugh at the fact we had dared to complain. Suggest whatever franchise Reeds holds within Best Western should clear out some of the staff otherwise this will shut down anytime soon. 
-4	Great looking place, great staff shame about the poor quality food offering. I had a chicken,ham,mushroom pie (they have quite a selection of pies therefore you view they must be great pie makers) unfortuantly the serving could have been in line with the old Little Chef creations, i.e. a cheap effort supplied by the likes of Brakes foodservice. The meat was diced which is a giveway with a soggy pastry lid, crap is the only word I can use.  My partner had a burger, but again they served up the driest burger I have seen no relish no noithing, along side half cooked chips. I made comments to the staff and the chef (So called) came out to say sorry but please call in again and we will try to improve! no offer to reduce the bill so why would you return?  So I wouldnt bother if I were you.
-4	 We arrived when the Angel was full and duly took a seat in the lounge to await an empty table as instructed by the staff. Whilst waiting it became apparent that we had been forgotten and others given tables ahead of us. When questioned, the same staff member said she'd thought we'd left even though we sat right by the restaurant door! Nt surprising we duly left not to return! 
-4	 We called in when we were visiting our daughter but wished we had not. The meals took an age to come out and were cold. We asked for them to be reheated but when they came back they were spoiled. Avoid this place at all costs. 
-4	 A group of us dined at the Verandah tonight. My colleagues opted for their banquet/gourmet menu (starter, main, side and sundry) but as I'm watching the weight I just went for the veg balti and rice at £7.95. When the bill arrived I was charged for the gourmet meal. When I asked them to adjust the bill ow was told that because my colleagues had the gourmet menu I had to pay for it to.  When I asked why I should pay for food in didn't have I was to It is clearly stated on the menu. When I asked where on the menu I was told it was stated on a price of paper left on the table. When I asked which piece of paper I was told that it was not left out tonight. So when I then asked how I should know their silly rules they told me that they assumed I has been before and knew how it all worked. So utter rubbish really on their part.  When I asked what difference it made they came up with some gibberish about people sharing food. I see how that makes sense with a buffet but not a fixed course - why would it matter if people shared their starter or side? We paid for it and I often share courses.  The sad reality to is that the difference between my meal and the gourmet menu was only £3, but it's the principle, I was mislead and over-charged. But they refused to reduce the price.   Needless to say me and my friends won't be going back. 
-4	 I took my girlfriend here for a meal to celebrate her birthday. The service was ok. The atmosphere was ok. The food however was awful. My girlfriend started with the scallops which she enjoyed, and I the king prawns. They were very bland and had barely any meat on them. Our main courses were possibly the 2 worst meals we've ever had. My girlfriend had the duck and I had the Rib-Eye steak. The steak was so chewy and didn't taste of anything. The duck tasted awful and was swimming in a pool of very unappetising ratatouille. A few hours after we left the restaurant my girlfriend became ill and spent all night in the bathroom vomiting. We spoke to a doctor who said that it was most likely the scallops that gave her food poisoning.  I sent an email to the restaurant stating that we were disappointed with the meal and it had made my girlfriend ill. I got an incredibly patronising and rude response and they didn't apologise. I replied by saying that I was still unhappy and didn't appreciate being patronised, and didn't get a response back. I would strongly advise you to steer clear. 
-4	 We love Japanese food but this is defiantly the worst in town. It appears to be Japanese food cooked by Chinese. The waiter was rude. When we asked if the waiter if he recommended the Japanese beer he said, I'm not Japanese', rather grumpily, we were just trying to make conversation really. The food was awful! There was no sushi, probably a god send in hindsight. I ordered a tofu ramen, which was packet noodles in water with a few bits of tofu and vegetable floating in it, very bland and spring rolls which were obviously straight from the freezer . My girlfriend had a miso soup which tasted sweet and was disgusting. She also ordered the yasai katsu curry which was a greasy mush! My advice go to pompoko or even wagamama is better. 
-4	 Best keep on walking, there are some great eats in the area, this is not one of them..  Food was covered in oil, cold, and basically uneatable.  For a drink the place is ok, otherwise avoid... 
-4	Its not so much the food, had a turkey dinner but it was a bit sparse to say the least we mentioned it but were not taken seriously at first. When my wife mentioned it quietly on paying the lady became angry and defensive. Total joke of coustomer service, we laughed about it all afternoon. Obviously we will never be back, lots of decent cares around in Malton, especially since its becoming a foodie place. Hopefully this place wont survive much longer as its an embarrasment to the town. The high number of bad reviews on here are not undeserved. We also smell badly of old frying oil, place stank of it! Definatley avoid, or go just for the ammusement of it.
-4	 What a shame, lovely old pub spoilt by shocking bad service and very very poor good, and the staff don't seem to care one bit. Avoid at all cost and pop down the road to McDonald's!!! 
-4	The food in this supposedly greek tavern was Terrible and not worth a light. You are better going off to McDonalds and eating there and saving a few quid at the same time. Don't know if all the staff are authentic Greeks, but the food is definatley not. If you want good greek food go to Green lanes in N4 Then you will taste and eat the real McCoy at half the price of this lot.
-4	 Went there as because last time 1year ago it was good, however what a joke! The service is terrible, manager does not care and some of the staff are just rude. Our order for eight people came out wrong, and what came out was 4 out of 10. Avoid the place! 
-4	 Food all good, kitchen has a full and varied menu, great choriso, gambas etc. Meal was spoilt by the rude Manager with the grey mullet/moustache. He spent most of the time flirting with the young (kind but untrained) waitresses and was very rude when asked for assistance.  At the end of the evening he could be seen drinking heavily with a couple of his mates and was clearly much more interested in having a good time himself than looking after his customers. The restaurant owners really need to sort this out because the kitchen is doing all the right things and its a real shame that it is all put in jepardy by one employee. 
-4	 After hearing a friend talk about the cupcakes here I thought I'd give it a go. Who could have predicted that I would walk away from Fall Angel disappointed, dispirited, and baffled? The cupcakes are bad, which is &quot;good&quot;, because you don’t want to stick around Fallen Angel any longer than necessary.  This place is generally very, very bad: prices that knock the wind out of you and moments of baking so cack-handed, so foul, so astoundingly grim you want to congratulate the kitchen on its incompetence. Very poor service with obnoxious and toxic staff that clearly don't care about the customer. This is a customer-facing environment and the staff have very poor people skills. 
-4	I have to say I have just experienced the worst customer care at a restaurant in years. It started almost from the moment we sat down and the first order of drinks arrived at the table where the order given was not what arrived at the table. When this was highlighted the answer came came 'well that was put in the system' - well that may have been true but it was not the order given to the waiter. Then came our the time to order our starters - actually it never did because no one came! Leave the party of 10 of us to make our own way to the carvery. Throughout the main meal once again no one came to take orders for more drinks and the empty plates remained on the table for over 45 minutes. Well finally I went up to the 'newly' appointed Restaurant manager I got the most 'off hand' response as if I was in the wrong rather than the lack of a waiter or customer service. Finally when the deputy manager did arrive he could not been more apologetic which leads one to the conclusion that this situation has happened many times before. I now find that this restaurant has been given a Certificate of Excellence for 2014....... I would hate to eat at a place where they failed to get a certificate. I estimate that form our party that they failed to increase their takings by £120.00.
-4	 Me n my partner went to the harvester today even knowing they got closed down due to health n safety reasons but thought we would give it a try as they must have improved their standards!! How wrong were we!!! This is our 2nd visit we both eat steak med-rare the 1st visit there was four of us n none of us could eat our steak all four steaks were full of fat n grizzle we complained to be offered a new steak even then they were the same we complained again n they offered us a desert....which none of us wanted so asked could they take some money off the bill even then they could only take 10% off!!!  Tonight me and my partner went just to give it another try it was busy n tables were messy.... We were seated straight away but just sat down n menus chucked in front of us no offer of a drink..... It took abou 20 mins for a waitress to take our order! It then took a further 10 minuets to get our glasses for refill Pepsi...... The starters came out soon after bbq sauce was missing from the chicken wings but we let that go....we once again had both ordered steak med-rare my partners steak came out well done mine was ok but once again full of fat and grizzle! The meals both came out without peas and the chips were shocking looked like they had been warmed up in a microwave were barley warm!!! Staff look miserable look like they don't want be there they are only in it for their wage packet n don't care about complaints n try to avoid you!!! Never ever again will we go back there n if anyone was to ask my advice on this restaurant I would advise them not to waste their money! 
-4	 Shopping trip to Meadowhall with wife and two sons. Decided to have a sit down meal and picked Harvester in Oasis. Shown to table and after 15 minutes wait invited to order. Went for the Meal Deal at £9..99 and order taken by manager who must be working to a ridiculous script as we were asked &quot;Have you been to Harvester before&quot; and when I said &quot;No&quot; I was immediately asked &quot;Will you come again?&quot;. Ordered food and it appears that you cannot ask for Gourmet Burger but without Bacon & Cheese and you are ceratinly not allowed to ask for Well Done without being told off and told bluntly that &quot;We are not a Steak House and it comes as it is&quot;. So two burgers , and two gammon with egg ordered. Drinks arrived but tea cup had large chip on rim. It was changed but with the comment &quot;Sorry Darling&quot; to my wife.  Food arrvied but two gammon with pineapple. Changed for egg but with one egg arriving minutes later on it's own plate!! Gammon was very undercooked and had simply been flashed under a grill but ate without complaining. Now late so our two sons left while we asked for the bill.Apparently we had all committed a cardinal sin by not taking the ice cream course as when the bill arrived it was based on individual menu prices. When queried we are told that this was because we hadn't taken the ice cream!! Offered to pay £39.96 but declined by the manager who then proceeded to escort my wife to the door!!!  I have formally complained to Harvester and look forward to their response. My advice is to give this one a miss. 
-4	This was possibly the worst experience I have had in a café before. The staff were rude, didn't understand what we wanted, we had probably 4 different waitresses, all extremely scatty. Food was cold and bland. One waitress started cleaning two of the four plates away and then just left the rest, clearly got distracted doing something else. They took forward to come over and ask if we wanted anything else, we just wanted the bill and get out of there... when we got the bill we wanted to just split it between two people.. well this confused them greatly, so much so that they had to get other staff to try and figure out how to do this. Paying the bill took around 10-15 minutes as they couldn't work out how to use the card machine. I was embarrassed for them. Awful awful awful.. Stay away!
-4	 Great party with good friends utterly ruined by rude, over officious staff.   Live band booked for the event were forced to play at very low levels despite the audiences calls to turn the music up.  The power was even turned off despite the already unreasonably low volume.  The lack of courtesy was extended to the birthday girl as well when the venue kept the piped music playing during her thank you speech, the height of rudeness! 
-4	To start ill say i have been here before and it was very good.  Next ill say on this particular day it was shocking. In fact the worst restaurant experiance I have had. We walked in and got seated after about 15mins but thats fine because you can't plan when tables of people will be leaving. After being seated we were totally left. After about 40 minutes of waiting to get our food ordered I went to the bar and asked if i could order food. Only then did they send someone over to our table.  The food came and it was good. Although they gave us one dish of vegetables between 6 people? I mean we got one big yorkshire pudding too but thats big enough for everyone to have a bit. The vegetables were about 2 broccoli trees each. We did complain about this and got told everyone is having smaller portions as the chef(gary) said he made enough for 200 people but they had extras come in that weren't booked. So if you can't cater for extras either don't accept them or over buy food?  Another thing. My father was at the bar and a staff member came out shouting about how Gary (chef but also owner?) was going mental about table 6. Which was us. The reason he was going mental was because we were placed on a table meant for 12 people and there was only 6 of us.  Firstly this table was the only one available when we came in therefore we had to go there to be seated. If we had waited for a smaller table we would have waited 40+minutes for it. The thing is there wasn't any more big parties around it was just us and smaller families. My dad stuck up for hannahs decision to seat us here and if gary thinks its is acceptable to be a chef in the kitchen and shout at staff about front of house decisions he needs to sort himself out. Especially when its not a big deal. If he wanted to manage then manage, get in a chef though.  The next thing wrong was after our dinner we waited an hour before deciding we weren't getting asked if we wanted pudding, which we did. So we paid and left. We did talk to some other customers on other tables and they waited over an hour for their puddings to come out. So I'm glad the general opinion was bad and not just us.  Severely understaffed all day. By 6pm there was 2 members of staff left and about 50 people in the restaurant absolutely ridiculous. Its mothers day, you have 200 guests booked. You will need staff throughout the whole day?  Its safe to say I will be telling people about how shockingly understaffed they are and not be coming back here again. Whatever Gary is to this restaurant I hope he changes his management style because currently it seems like he's someone you would see on Gordon Ramseys Kitchen Nightmares.  Finally I would like to say fair play to the girls who were left (hannah and gemma i think) because they were working hard trying to get through everything. Too bad Gary hadn't got more staff in to cover all tables. I mean our puddings would have been around £27 more they would have made on the day.   Bad bad bad. With 50+ reviews on Trip Advisor mainly good might I add. This is my worst review of a restaurant.
-4	 Me and my girlfriend thought we would try this new relatively new venue out for a Thursday night supper. The pub is well decorated and it is in a great location. However the service was terrible, the staff could not explain half the drinks or food on the menu. Waiters were not assigned to tables and we had multiple members of staff interrupting us asking the same questions. The couple next to us had to wait 45 mins for some sharer starters and they forgot to bring their drinks.   All in all this place is a nice concept but the service is terrible, the food is average and it is way too over priced. 
-4	 I first visited the Drum when it first re-opened. It was empty, but we received good service and a decent meal. Nothing special, but not bad.  I then visited again with my mum. We were asked to wait at the bar for a table to become available, which we were happy to do, but when we were seated an hour later, it was a large table and other patrons thought it was OK to put their coats on our chairs, and sit down next to us. The group who had 'joined us' were swearing and shouting loudly, making it incredibly hard for us to hear each other. We promptly left.  The third (and final time) I visited The Old Drum, I was with 2 of my friends. We were told that we could sit where we liked because it was empty, but they would not serve food for another hour. We were hungry, but took our drinks and bar snacks to the table, and waited for food service to begin.  We were given menus around 15 minutes before dinner service, and then within 5 minutes, we were asked to leave our table because it had been reserved. We explained that we had been told we could sit there, but this lady insisted we move. She then took our menus off us and said that she needed to give us new menus.  Dinner service began half an hour later than we were originally told (at our new table) and I ordered a burger (minus the bun). I was expecting a home made burger, but instead, I received a lump of minced meat (there was literally no onions, herbs, spices etc) that was cold and raw in the middle.  It was a terrible meal, with terrible service and I will not be returning! Stay away and go to a decent pub! Fur coat and no knickers..... :-/ 
-4	 We visited this new restaurant for a late breakfast on their opening weekend earlier this summer. After waiting for 45 minutes we finally received our food which was poorly presented and wasn't good value considering the wait. At that time, we told the floor manager that to succeed in Streatham High Road you need quick service, as venues like this aren't a destination but a place you grab a meal on the way to somewhere else. We promised to return once they'd settled in.  Last Sunday morning we did. There were many tables with people chatting however worringly, not much food was seen on the tables. Two young waiting staff were doing their best to manage the floor, with no apparent senior support. The decor which is industrial offers promise of a no-nonsense approach however, when customers behind us remarked that they'd waited for 30 minutes for their breakfast to arrive, we decided to cut our losses and left. Clearly those early teething problems had not been sorted.   Sadly, Brighton Way, seems to think that industrial chic and a good menu make for a successful business however in the end of the day if you can't get a breakfast on the table within 10 minutes like Purple used to down the road, then it won't be where most will want to while away 30 minutes or so. Whiling that time away on an empty stomach in a shabby bistro isn't exactly hitting a high in Streatham. Fortunately, Perfect Blend nearer that station is a slicker more established restaurant and can produce a decent full English breakfast on the table within 10 minutes. 
-4	 It really annoys me that such a lame place is taking up such a prime spot. There used to be a Subways in its place and I was so glad when that closed, thinking that anything else would be better. Quayside is such a beautiful and vibrant area that desperately needs another place that can live up to the other restaurants there. Unfortunately Creme du Cafe does not quite cut it and I'm even beginning to think that Subways used to be a better tenant for the space. Service is awful, the menu is poor, coffee not very nice and worst of all, the outdoor furniture is just really cheap and tacky and uncomfortable. Quayside is an area where people spend time, as in whole afternoons and evenings, going from one venue to another and this place is simply not very inviting. It really is a waste of space, as it's taking up such a great venue that has so much potential 
-4	 Gone downhill quicker than a swiss skier. Used to be the place to go in Walsall but last time we went there (and embarrassingly took friends) they served up 'fake' king prawns that were merely seafood sticks shaped like prawns. They changed the dish straight away when we complained, fair one considering they were trying to charge £17 for 'fake' king prawns. The rest of the food was okay but significantly overpriced and even though a Sat night it was deserted. Such a shame, used to be a great place to eat. 
-4	 We went to the Hotel du Vin a while back and were not too impressed but made a more recent visit and ...O dear.. our worst fears were realised. The Hotel du Vin in Winchester now shows all the signs of an establishment in full decline i.e. high prices, indifferent service and poor food. After all, the &quot;restaurant&quot; is, in fact, not much better than a pub (have known pubs more comfortable) and to charge, for example, £6 for a pint of bitter is extortionate! You expect to pay a little more in a hotel but there is a 5-star not too far away that prices its beer at £4 which I would say is a reasonable mark-up. Other prices were in line. The meal I had was small and almost uneatable.I ordered braised lamb which turned out to be a small piece of rolled lamb which was just about eatable in the middle but the rest had been so over-cooked it was hard and dry. This rested on a smear of gloop which was described as potatoes. It was supposed to be served with capers and anchovies but there was no sign of any anchovies. I suppose the capers might have been in the wipe of sauce on top but as this was flavourless it was difficult to say. I have never had a tasteless caper before. The pudding of quince and apple crumble was warm on the top and stone cold in the middle. This was served with 'double cream' - quite the smallest portion and the runniest double cream I have ever seen. The service was indifferent to say the least. I do not mind waiting a bit between courses but I do object to having to look for ages at dirty plates. The staff spent more time chatting among themselves than serving us.We were cramped on a table which, from the position of the legs, would take about two at the most. Awful. 
-4	We had booked a table well in advance and on entering we were told how busy they were. Taken to a table on the mezzanine level. We ordered 2 lagers which were promptly brought over to our table. Disgusting flat lager with the most awful olives I've had the misfortune of trying.We left immediatley realising our terrible mistake. Garbage.
-2	One of the older pubs in Keswick. Problem is there are so many old men who have been sitting in the same seat for donkeys years and they DO NOT LIKE customers/visitors sitting in &quot;THEIR&quot; seats. One old bloke throws his walking cane at the seat another is so incredibly rude. What does the landlord do?... nothing. Plenty of other places to eat and drink in the town. Try them.. most are great.
-2	The waiter seemed disinterested in us and the food was mediocre. The place was virtually empty so there was no excuse. Really disappointing and ruined what was meant to be a nice family outing.
-2	 I have no idea how this place gets its high rating.  The restaurant was empty bar one other diner when I arrived. There was no drinks menu. the waiter, albeit a very polite gentleman, explained that there were only a couple of beers available and they were downstairs. I asked for a Cobra and eventually something lager-ish looking turned up.  I ordered my meal. No sooner had i done so it was explained to me that they didn't have card facilities - cash only. No card facilities in a hotel/restaurant? Says a lot about the kind of place it is.  Luckily, or unluckily, there is a cash machine that charges for withdrawals, right opposite the establishment. Dont you just hate having to pay to get your own money out. Anyway, having withdrawn some cah I wandered back to my luke warm pint and awaited my food.  The first course was a mixed grill starter. It was the smallest one I have ever had. The quality was ok but no real flavour to distinguish the various elements and the onion bargee was dripping in oil.  The main was a chicken balti with naan bread. I've had a few of these over the years and this one was pretty poor. The bread was stodgy but the balti sauce was ok. Most of the chicken was grey and stringy.  I had to ask for a napkin. None were provided. Very odd for a restaurant. I needed a VAT receipt for my expenses. No, they arent VAT registered either. I find it incredible that a hotel/restaurant like this isn't.  The waiter was very polite and helpful but I really cannot see how this place gets so many five star ratings. Good luck to them though 
-2	We have tried to order a Saturday night takeaway 3 times now since it's opening in February 2014. However, we have yet to have the phone answered and there is also no capability to order online.   I understand that early Saturday night is a busy time but not to answer the phone at all is surprising. Furthermore, going to the restaurant is also not guaranteed being served as we found out last week. After a 20minute wait at the door we were told that a wait of a further 90mins was likely.  Given the fact that this restaurant is part of a wider chain in Sussex, I would have thought such basic opening issues might have been ironed by now. However, they seem to be continuing with no noticeable improvement.  In conclusion, Haywards Heath's restaurant experience has not improved with the closure of River Thai and the opening of this replacement. I really hope this is merely a short term problem as return business is surely slipping away.
-2	 Oh dear. The fantastic salt and chilli squid is never on the menu and the staff appear permanently bemused by life. The kitchen doesn't help them (we sent the so called &quot;sourdough&quot; bread back twice for breaching the Trade Descriptions Act, only to be told that the kitchen &quot;says it really is sourdough&quot; - which means they are either liars or have no taste, either of which is worrying). This place used to be a great local. What a shame. 
-2	 My wife and I went to TGIs last Saturday with our 10 month old baby, 4 year old daughter and her just turned 5 friend.  The service was friendly enough, but it was slow and not very attentive, something that is quite important when you've got hungry and bored children on your hands.  When the main course did eventually come, they had missed out one of the older kids meals, which caused some upset. After a few minutes they brought out the other meal, minus the potatoe option, again, some more upset.   We had to ask for drink refills, and generally found the dining experience to just be a bit poor. My wife said her meal was inedible. 
-2	 Thought the fish and chips at a fishing port like Polperro would be something special but was hugely disappointed. The fish was overcooked and the batter terrible. The opening hours seemed to be flexible and it closed quite early which was a surprise considering the potential tourist trade. If you want fish and chips I recommend you get a takeaway from one of the other restaurants in Polperro. It might be a little more expensive but it couldn't be any worse. 
-2	 This is probably the best location in Broadstairs. It should be a great place to go, but has never really managed to live up to its potential. We thought the conservatory would be a big improvement, but the only thing it seems to have brought it limited menu with ridiculous, jacked-up prices. Now it most closely resembles a glorified Wetherspoon's but without the reasonable prices!  We popped in during Folk Week for lunch, with memories of things like the delicious and reasonable plate of sardines we had in times before, but were surprised at how little was on offer and how expensive it was. £10 for a Greek salad - nudging £8 for a jacket spud? Complete mickey-take! We got up and walked out 
-2	 This Pub has gone down hill recently, food is OK but no sign of brewing their own beer any more. I asked them to book a taxi and the taxi charged me £40 to go less than 3 miles to Ealing Common at 10pm with no traffic. 
-2	 This place used to be good with reasonable service, nice meals and a wonderful setting. I don't know if its changed hands but the service is now underwhelming and clueless and the food matching. It's a shame because this was a really good hidden gem.   
-2	 My girlfriend and I went here for a new years eve meal and were both very unhappy with our dining experience. The evening started off well, with us being greeted by very friendly staff and a nice atmosphere, but it soon went down hill. They were very understaffed for a busy new years eve which meant the poor staff that were working were having to cope with to many tables/people. We (and all the tables around us) had very long waits for food to arrive, and when our main course did arrive it was not what we had asked for. The food was an ok standard but defiantly not worth the high price (over £27 pp for a 2 course set menu) as well as a £3.50 supplement for a very mediocre sirloin steak. We wont be returning after our experience, which almost ruined new years eve. 
-2	 Oh Dents, you could do SO much better! We attended on 15/09 for breakfast following the nursery run, 2 adults, a 7 month old and 18 month old.   We ordered drinks to begin with. The coffees were brought out, food ordered and I had to remind them to bring out the drink for the toddler. We ordered a side of toast for the toddler which came out plain - no butter. We ordered scrambled eggs which were quite soft/runny. They were brought out to us and left. We had to ask for cutlery several minutes later when they brought out some ketchup, by which time the food was going cold.   Another point to add - its always wise to place a tray and serve hot food and drinks away from children. Seems a very simple, common sense point to make but apparently not as the coffees were placed in reach of the toddler who promptly tried to touch them. Service generally slow and disorganised.   Finally, we ended up having to wait at the till to pay for several minutes. People came out of the kitchen and ignored us and it just so happened that someone walked through and saw us. Not impressed 
-2	 Arrived at 10:50hrs, waited 15 minutes for a menu to be delivered. The staff did not seem to care. Waited another 6 minutes before walking out. The server at the till look absolutely surprised when we said &quot;you are too slow&quot;. Although not a &quot;fast food chain&quot;, the staff at Le Pain Quotidien, Kings Road Chelsea, should spend sometime at McDonalds, to get a few tips on customer service. 
-2	We arrived at just after 9 am with not other customers in the cafe. It took 10 minutes for anyone to even notice we were in the cafe and tell us to order at the counter! On ordering it became clear that some of the items on the menu were not available as no one had actually thought to order in for Monday morning! It took nearly half an hour for the breakfasts we had ordered to arrive. The food was OK but no more than that.  By the way if you are thinking of appropriate music in a cafe please try and remember that James Bond themes blasted out at 9 am on a Monday morning may not work for your customers!
-2	 Sorry Zizzi but you are consistently poor at evening service. Prices too high for a mediocre experience. We went in a group of 15, it was great to have our own area set aside, credit where it's due, but the food just wasn't up to scratch and it's not the first time. Mussels with crushed up mussel shells in your pasta, yuk! 
-2	 Visited on the evening of Saturday 5th July, On the plus side the hotel is everything you would expect, clean, very presentable ( although everything pristine, a little dated ). We wanted to have a drink in Zains bar on arrival, but this was closed for a private party and the main bar although we could get a drink,again appeared to have a private party in, so we opted to go to straight into Tawnys, we were greeted and sat at lovely table and at the time including us there were just 12 people dining, Our order was taken by a polite but very curt waitress, just felt she left us feeling a little cold. Drinks arrived quite promptly but we did have to wait a while for our starters, no bread rolls were offered and in fact the restaurant manager tried to clear our plates then noticing that we still had our starters, We had the sharing platter for starters which was very nice bbq sauce excellent, the other 2 sauces a little tasteless. For our main (sorry this is where it goes down hill) we both opted for the lamb shanks which were very tender but that's it tender and not much taste, the shanks were supposed to be served on a bed of lyonnaise potatoes well these tasted no more than boiled and sliced potatoes without a trace of onion more like some thing you would expect in a hospital canteen, Our very curt waitress noticed we were not eating and in her defense did ask if we wanted something else of which we declined, the restaurant manager presented us the dessert menu again, we politely declined and we were presented with the bill, obviously they wanted us to go. no offer of coffee or further drinks were offered. disappointing!! 
-2	The buffet was not so nice but the surroundings and service were excellent.
-2	 went for a meal 07.08.16, told no availability until 4 pm (this was at 1.30 pm !!!!!!) it was less than a quarter full and the reason given was that they were short by 2 chefs(which apparently is a common excuse according to the friends we came with). To turn away 5 adults and 3 children for food when you are virtually empty seems like business suicide to me. I found the place unwelcoming and yet it has clearly been refurbished to a high standard so I cant understand why you would spend so much money and then ruin it by not putting in place simple things like customer service and using common sense 
-2	New Years day 2015 and thought what a lovely day to go for a meal. We decided to head towards Bathampton as there a few excellent places that do food unforntunatley we picked the duff one &quot;George Inn&quot; We were greated by a friendly chap and were seated within minutes the nice lady who served us was efficient at first but once the order was taken we never saw her again. I am putting this experience down to poor management for understaffing on New Years day, we ordered around 2pm and by 310pm were given our starters 30mins later we got our main meals delivered and nothing else no table call back service as one of the meals were actaully very greasy and the chips were dried as if they'd been under a hotlamp for quite sometime. We waited and waited for the staff to come past but they were so busy we hardly seen them. The main meal of Gammon (Greasy pinapple, dried up fried egg & very greasy fatty gammon slice) was totally left. We requested the bill where the guy came over and noticed that one dish hadnt been touched however nothing was said so as a point we remained silent to see his actions. Nothing! I feel that an excellent day was only spolit by poor understaffing and lack of table call back that could of resolved this issue.
-2	 The Albert was disappointing. The décor is tatty, the tables and carpet felt grubby. A revamp is in need. The restaurant area was stuffy and could have done with a window or two opened. The staff were friendly but the best place to sit and drink was outside in the small courtyard to the side. Would be good on a sunny day. Disappointing for a Robinson’s pub. 
-2	 I have been in Bromley yesterday with my wife and daughter to shopping around and we decide to eat in Carluccio's, not only for the reputation they have but because I have ate several times in other Carluccio's and we enjoyed the Italian cuisine. We have calamari as start and my baby have grissini , macaroni cheese and orange juice, ( kids menu). I have Luganica sausage and my wife linguini seafood.. I have tried to find the &quot;luganica sausage&quot; on my plate and it was just a kind of tomato sauce? Do not even taste luganica...The linguine seafood came with 1 prawn and 5 mussels,which 2 of them was empty.I was embarrassing in front of my family and certain of time I just think to leave the place. I'm Chef in England for the last 17 years and I meet and worked with must of famous Chef include Carluccio's and Charlie Bigman's and I believe Carluccio's family don't know what happen on this place. It's really embarrassing and shamed, The money I have spend do not worth. 
-2	It's not terrible but not great. Cool concept for a bar but not enough effort put into making it something special. The manager is a friendly guy iv spoken to a few times and he seems nice but hires some terrible staff. Especially the absolute cretin with wavey brown semi long hair. I get it, your a bar man and can make good drinks that doesn't mean I'm going to bow down to you in the way you seem to expect. Poor staff, cool concept, not enough effort.
-2	 The Thai Terrace only takes cash and my advice here is to ask for a receipt as after paying went back to my table to get our belongings together and as we left got chased by staff saying we had not paid!!! As for the food, it's ok but there is not much choice and was very average - would definitely not go again, after eating we had a little walk around the area and saw so many more options that we wished we went for! 
-2	 Ordered chip sandwiches for three of us with drinks. When our meal arrived the butter was rock hard! Still wasnt fit to spread on bread 25 minutes later! And when spoke to manager she said 'chip sandwiches aren't ordered regular and butter is normally for jacket potato' Well if thats the case what do they spread on sandwiches!! Manager wasnt bothered and offered us no response. Very poor customer service!! 
-2	 Sorry to say that on our Wednesday lunching out we were disappointed with the Duke.Nice big place,friendly welcome but freezing told the boiler had packed up.(fire not a light) Beers were fine but the food was not up to standard the steak and Stilton sauce was over cooked and tough,chips were dry frozen not good.Sorry will not go again. 
-2	We have eaten here many times and the food is good. Being sat next to a giant wine rack while it is being filled is bad. Having to listen to the staff complaining and arguing about who did what and when is worse. If you don't like working there then leave. Diners have little interest in listening to your drama. To top it off, you then started moving the table and chairs next to the wine rack while we were eating. Come on guys. You can do better than this.
-2	 Decided to give this place a second chance.  Poor decision.  Party of 11 for grandsons birthday. Food was cold again. Not just me this time, several of our party had the same.   Heard what sounded like a heard of elephants pounding on the ceiling directly above us. So concerned were we that we thought the ceiling would give at any moment. We complained and it turned out to be the evenings entertainment, clog dancers, practicing in one of the rooms.  To make us more uncomfortable, we were sat next to a radiator belting out too much heat!  Dear, dear me...never again! 
-2	the meal we had was insipid not very hot and the gravy tasted like watery bisto!!or a cheaper alternative. Wont bother again also found it rather expensive considering the quality which was poor ,i dont mind paying for quality andwe have been here before when it first opened and it was very good,but the quality has slipped and is nowhere near what it was last summer when it first opened, still the village is pretty and the pub itself has been sympathetically renovated.
-2	 We went there for a birthday meal with family. The service / staff very friendly and helpful, however the food was a bit of a let down. The brisket was very fatty, the pulled pork was very stodgy. All in all I was a bit disappointed. I won't be rushing back. 
-2	 Called in for a meal after driving home from Scotland, with two hungry,bored children! Nothing for the kids (9 & 11) to do.Ordered the meals and were told that if we ordered from the main menu not the &quot;two for&quot; menu the kids were free, usual complicated &quot;order from this to get that etc&quot; menu. Chicken dinner for our eldest son was pathetic, 3 small boiled potatoes, some peas and a slice of compressed,processed chicken. Our meals basic and uninspiring. Then they attempted to charge us for the kids meals. After a long drive back to Yorkshire, a poor end to the day. Got home with kids to feed!! 
-2	 Polpo as a name is well established now and I had eaten in Sputino and enjoyed it a few years back so decided to try Polpo. The good points were the staff were friendly and it's a pretty cool laid back place. Also I managed to be seated straight away which really should have set alarm bells ringing as other bar style restaurants in the area always have massive queues.  The bad points were the food. Bland under seasoned aranchini and croquettas lacked flavour or texture. Saffron Risotto appeared about 4 mins after ordering and tasted like it came out the microwave. The saffron completely overpowered it. The Tiramisu was quite nice, the one redeeming feature of a very average meal.  Really disappointed overall, this place had a lot of acclaim when it opened and clearly something has gone very wrong. 
-2	Have been here before and it has always been good. Today something wasn't quite right. We ordered a ham and pickle sandwich - white, because I'm a wuss and crusty bread cuts my mouth. My wife ordered a hot roast beef and gravy baguette, with a side of chips to share. The barman even repeated the order back to her. We got two (very thin) baguettes, mine had the ham with pickle so thin it dripped out while I was eating it. Hers had some slightly warm beef slices - barely warm enough to melt the butter and no sign of gravy - and no chips! When we asked the barman, he said we hadn't been charged as he'd forgotten to &quot;put them through&quot; and did we still want them. We said no because the small baguettes were almost eaten by then. My wife then ordered a glass of dry rose. After looking at her for a few seconds, he handed her a menu and told her to pick one. Obviously not the brightest bulb on the Xmas tree. Very slapdash and evidently, poorly trained staff made this a bit of a letdown for us. It's a 2 hour drive for us to get here and put a bit of a downer on the day. I'll be visiting the Jolly Sailor next time I think.
-2	 Four adults and two children ate here to celebrate an Auntie's 90th birthday. Most of us including the celebrant ordered from the 2 or 3 course fixed price lunch.   'Chicken Soup for the Soul' was thick, glutinous and tasted mainly of chilli with hardly any flavour of chicken. The steak was extremely tough although the 'frites' were ok. Worst of all, the birthday girl received an extremely underwhelming and small sea bass filet complete with it's tail which looked as though it had been picked at by cats. The green beans and peas were also small in quantity. A second piece of fish was offered on hearing our comments.   The desserts were better and on hearing that we were celebrating a birthday, the apple pie came with a lit candle. Service was good. 
-2	 After looking around for a restaurant in the Stafford area I thought I'd give The Labour In Vain a try. Lots of good reviews made the pub seem promising. With hopes for a lovely meal I certainly came out disappointed. I ordered the trio of pork which was rather tough and the whole meal lacked substance, if you like generous portions this is a no go. My wife went for the classic steak and ale pie, a staple pub meal that should leave one satisfied and yet although big enough, was not really up to the standard you might expect. It wasn't all doom and gloom however as the young waitress was nice and made us feel welcome, though she did seem quite stretched as I believe she was the only waitress there that night, a bit strange for a Friday evening I did think. If you like your bitter, the Doombar was very good and the recommended Bass was nice too. I'm certainly not a fussy customer and don't expect world class food from a little country pub, in fact I'm rather a fan of the chain of Hungry Horse pubs, but I just felt disappointed when I came out after paying a fairly high price for pub food. It seems that maybe this pub is more popular with the locals in the small village of Yarnfield, than those passing through looking for a hearty meal. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.  Andrew. 
-2	When we saw the sign ALL DAY BREAKFAST, We really didn’t expect to spend all day waiting for it!!! We arrived at 11.00 & ordered. The restaurant was lively and was doing brisk trade but we found a table for 4 of us with no problem. That's where the fun stopped. Along with several other families, We waited & waited for what seemed forever. After about 45 mins, whilst the orders were still being taken at the till, We started to hear the staff telling New arrivals that there was a 'bit of a wait' for food. You're not kidding!! After 1.5 hrs waiting, with no explanation or apology my Omelette arrived. The waitress seemed oblivious to the fact it was so very late.  We ate the food, which was actually pretty good and got up to leave the restaurant. NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF STAFF SPOKE TO US AS WE LEFT & THE MANAGER DISAPPEARED.  It would have been simple common courtesy to explain to the fuming families why these outrageous delays occurred, maybe offer a discount or at the very least an apology for the waiting around. SHAME ON YOU.
-2	 The steaks were cooked perfectly to our specifixcations, and that is what we had come for, so why have I rated The Carrington Arms as 'poor'?   We wanted to dine at 8 p.m., but the only available slots (34 hours in advance) were 6.45 or 9.15. We chose the former and were told that we had to vacate our table before 8. We felt as if we were part of a production line, geared to making maximum profit rather than giving maximum pleasure.  Our starter of 'crampi' (crayfish tails) was oily, tough and barely edible.   With her steak, my partner's salad was fine, and so were my chips, mushroom and tomato, but I had too few chips for the amount of steak. The accompanying little jugs of sauce were fine, but £2 extra seemed a bit grasping.   Worse was, however, to come. I chose 'peach melba' as a dessert. Peach melba can be delicious, but I received an underdone, tasteless poached peach, some icecream, some cubes of jelly, some rock-hard crunchy stuff which claimed to be meringue and two raspberries. What a jumble of ill-assorted ingredients! They would not have melded even if they had all been delicious, which they were not.   It would have been nice to end the meal with some cheeses (but none was offered on the menu) and some coffee, but it was 8 p.m. and we were shunted out, to make room for the next customers.  We can cook our own steaks (it's not difficult!) and the next time that we feel like eating some, we'll do so at home, at around one-third of the cost. Dining out should be an enjoyable experience. This was not. The staff were pleasant and helpful, and the 'conveyor belt' approach to customers was not of their making. But it will be more than ten years before we revisit this venue. 
-2	Had the curry special, arrived cold, as did second one, did not appear to know what to do when I answered the mandatory&quot;was everything alright?&quot; Question with no! Won't be going bacl
-2	 I arranged for a party of 8 to eat on a Thursday evening. The place is pleasant enough and the menu looked good.  However the food was very disappointing....average quality at best, although they were accommodating to make some changes to the set menu we'd ordered.  I've noticed that the service has been rated as high by others. Sadly we did not find this and even had a debate about whether not to pay the &quot;optional&quot; charge they added to the bill. We decided to do so on the grounds that there was insufficient staff there to meet customer needs. We had to remind them several times to bring drink orders etc.  They also seemed to have only one payment terminal.......which doesn't help when a large group decides each to pay individually.  Not up to the quality of other Thai Squares. 
-2	 Went here on a Saturday night with a party of 30 people. Saturday night is a buffet and disco. Drinks service at the table was really slow. The buffet food was pretty poor quality. The meat had a very strange texture, and the dishes were either very bland or incredibly over-spiced. The decor was old; carpets peeling and taped down, yellowing paint, etc. The disco was pretty good, but that wasn't the main reason for going to the restaurant! The bill was £60 for two adults and two kids, excluding drinks. There are better value Chinese restaurants in Brentwood where the service would be attentive and the food of a higher standard. If all you want is a bit of bland or spicy Chinese and a dance, then this is the place for you. 
-2	Visited with family and felt pretty unwelcome.when paying for my ice creams I asked for a bit of change for the car park and they refused. I later saw the manageress roll eyes with the girl behind the counter as the rest of my family hadn't ordered anything yet. A bit of customer service wouldn't go amiss. With regards to the ice creams, not bad but a bit sloppy and melt very quickly. Won't be returning.
-2	 Really nice position, however we had to wait far to long for our meal 3/4 of an hour just for fish&chips and were disappointed with the quality of the meal and the price, we had a lime &soda half of bitter and two fish and chips . Cost £30 not good 
-2	 Popped in for a lunchtime snack, how disappointing. We only wanted a simple lunch to keep us going, Ordered crab open sandwich and a pork pie from the bar snacks menu. Five minutes later we were told there were no pork pies. Ordered an alternative, we were then told none of the bar snack items were available. The crab sandwich was supposed to have baby watercress salad, none in evidence. The waitress was apologetic, it wasn't her fault, her service was fine, but the management need to get their act together and stock what they offer and serve what is described on the menu. 
-2	 I thought i would give this restaurant another chance each time but unfortunately nothing is consistent on each visit! the food seems to be thrown together rather than decorated nicely and i cant understand why there should be a delay for the arrival of food when the restaurant is not so busy on a friday evening? i think this might be due to the head chef leaving as i got talking with the waitress..i noticed the manager has changed also which is never a good sign? on the upside the place has good parking but all in all i feel sorry for this place as it could be much better! 
-2	The last time I visited Prezzo Buckingham in March this year the food was really good. I was recommending it to other people. I went last night and it was quite dissapointing. The starters were ok but where it fell down was the mains. I had a calzon carltoni and my wife the steak and rocket with olives. My calzone was only half full (if that) with the ends being just bread and very little filling in the middle. I showed it to the waiter who agreed that it was a bit light on the filling. He took it back saying he would have another one made in a couple of minutes. By the time he had returned my wife had finished AND the same again - very little filling. Maybe less than the one before. I showed it to the manager who started by making excuses about how it's hard to fold with a lot of filling or they put a prescribed amount in it. I said that for nearly £12 for some bread and not even a handful of filling it was ridiculous and that the waiter took it back the first time because he agreed it wasnt right. Eventually the manager agreed. This was after I suggested as the manager take responsibility for the issues rather than make excuses. On top of that my wifes meal wasnt the best being a bit light on the meat and only 2 olives. The result was our food was comped but after this experience I won't be going back.
-2	 Dined on bank holiday Monday over Easter. My mother law was the only one in a group of 7 who doesn't really like bloody red meat the rest of us really like it, so we thought we would give it a try.  Every time the chef came with the meat he would tell us what it was and then offered it out, everything pretty much tasted the same too much salt and far to much garlic. on the menu it said there would be 2 chicken dishes - there was only wings and also said there would be offal (hart and liver) there was not. The beef neck was the best of the meats.  The buffet island was a strange one, rice (check) potatoes (check) chips (cold but check) salad (Check) Microwaved Lasagna, Bananas in breadcrumbs...  wouldn't rush back 
-2	 Food was ok but far too expensive. Drinks very expensive. You are advised to order 3 tapas dishes each but when an ordinary tapas priced at £13 its too much . I dont mind paying £5 or £8 if its prawns etc but serano ham priced at £13 and u dont get any bread . Thats a little cheeky. All tasted ok but not the best. Potatoes bravas were very ordinary and lacking seasoning and flavour . Nice place , good vibe but really doesnt need to be so over the top with everything. Unfortunately wont be back. 
-2	 The service was fine and the food was presented in a timely manner, However it was very bland fare. The steak knives were next to useless. That said the price of the meal was in keeping with what was served up. 
-2	 Expensive and unwelcoming, stopped there after a Sunday walk, charged £8.20 for a pint & a half, bag of crisps and peanuts by Tom the surly barman, felt I was just an annoyance. Thought we might go there for a meal someday but there's plenty of good better value places in the area. 
-2	 Have been here a few times since it opened. At different times and on different days. My general experience is the place has uncleaned tables, often has no wipes or napkins etc and the waiting times for food can be far too long. One visit we got so tired of waiting for the one couple in front of us to be served, that we left in disgust. The food can be very hit and miss also.  As a family we love KFC and eat It now and then as a treat. On more than one occasion we have had basically cold food - changed when we complained, but it shouldnt be like that as often as we have had. We have now stopped using this branch.  Please sort it out!  
-2	This place is not situated in a great area, the staff aren't friendly and inside is just poorly decorated and unwelcoming. The outdoor seating area again, isn't great and I think overall this place is more suited to students, but I wouldn't even recommend it to them!
-2	 Visited as part of a group going onto Windsor races  We all had the same food, scotch egg ( good), pea/Ham soup ( served cold [ by mistake] and not as good as my own), pate ( nothing special and too runny), smoked salmon (very ordinary) , main course was chicken and ham pie, chips and carrots broccoli ( pie was dry and fairly tasteless, chips were worse than KFC chips, veg over cooked), dessert peach tart, pastry hard and no real taste.  I eat out three times a week and even basic pub grub is usually better than this.  Staff poorly dressed and uninterested in all of us. Head chef spoke to us before we are and tools usage were having certain food we did not have, unbelievable really   Wine, Spanish Temperello was excellent as was the real ale.  A very very disappointing meal, had travelled 200 miles for the experience, will not go again 
-2	 I ordered a rare steak and it arrived somewhere between medium and well done. I complained and it was replaced with a steak which was medium, for the restaurant to be unable to serve a decent steak is very poor. 
-2	 Pies are top quality, but at £14-£17 it's expensive. Potatoes and veg sides were horrible. Everything else about the place is very poor.   We mentioned a tastecard and they said they had reached there limit for the day!? 
-2	 It took us 15 minutes to be served 4 portions of chips. They were very tasty but massively expensive. A large portion of chips is almost as expensive as a piece of fish. How can that be right? 
-2	 We visited Edward Moon just last night and did not have a good experience.  Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor and reserved a table earlier in the week we were looking forward to our meal.  The staff were initially friendly, greeting us warmly upon our arrival and ushered us to a table at the front of the restaurant. Unfortunately this was about 6 inches away from an adjoining table and I asked if we could sit somewhere with more privacy. In short the answer was no because the restaurant was fully-booked and all of the tables were very close together.  Personally I don't enjoy being sat quite so close to fellow diners; I'd rather pay a little more for a meal and not be able to hear every word of their conversation. That said, this could be a personal preference but the seating in &quot;Moons&quot; reminded me very much of Strada and I was under the impression that the former is trying to court a different type of customer.  When we came to order, my wife and I found the menu quite uninspiring and although we were intending to have starter, main course and dessert both of us instead settled on just a main course of Bangers & Mash.  The meal itself was nice enough but bizarrely each of the sausages were very small, being roughly half the size of a regular sausage! There were three of these but I still thought the portion quite measly.  We declined dessert and asked for the bill but after waiting for 15 minutes while the waitress served the diners around us we stood up and walked to the till at the front. The waitress at the till didn't actually say anything to us but pushed a plate containing our bill across the counter. I asked &quot;Is this ours?&quot; and the waitress simply nodded and said &quot;Yes, can I have your card please?&quot; before suggesting &quot;Please follow the instructions on the card reader&quot;.  As the waitress had not bothered to ask &quot;Did you enjoy your meal&quot; or even &quot;Was everything ok for you?&quot; I chose not to add a gratuity to the bill.  Overall I thought the seating, menu and service were poor and the actual food average.  That said perhaps our expectations were too high and we'd been taken in by some of the over-positive reviews on Tripadvisor. Equally we're used to a high standard of dining as we have many local &quot;Gastro Pubs&quot; in our area which serve much better food with a lot less attitude.  - www.royaloakmarlow.co.uk - www.theoldebell.co.uk - www.stgeorgeanddragon.co.uk  However, &quot;Moons&quot; professes to be a restaurant which, in my mind at least, means it should be a step above the &quot;Gastro Pub&quot; level.  Having eaten at several other restaurants in Stratford (Lambs, Vintners, the Oppo and the Encore) I'd recommend each of these over Edward Moon. 
-2	 Location 5/5 Service quality 4/5 Service speed 1/5 Quality of food 3/5 Cleanliness 2/5 Value for money 2/5   Similar to another review.   Went 24th Jan, sunny but very cold. Car park moderately but not over busy. After walk, went in for coffee and cake at 2:30pm. Expected lunchtime rush to be over but from joining queue to getting coffee was 15 minutes. The two young ladies serving were working flat out but struggled to cope and looked very much in need of guidance and management. None could be seen.   Cappuccino , bottle of coke, pre-packaged gluten-free brownie and moderately dry flapjack - £9.40. Too much.   Location excellent. Tables not cleared quick enough. Limited choice of good presume again underestimated how busy - looks like recurring theme.   Outside tables clean. Prepare for wind on cliff side.   Shame.  Thanks to the ladies serving us, you were working flat out.   
-2	 Used to eat here frequently years ago. Found ourselves carrying heavy bags and this was the nearest port in a storm. Mistake!  The greeter found us a good table so things were looking good. It wasn't particularly busy. Waited ages while various staff walked past us avoiding eye contact or maybe we were invisible. At least it gave us time to discover how sticky the table was, though.  Drinks order was taken and we ordered our food. The server who brought the drinks slagged the other staff off for not setting the table and brought cutlery and napkins.   Our starter arrived after some time. Cremated potato skins which were crunchily carbonised. A new speciality! We ordered steak for our main course. Meat quality was poor. One was so tough it couldn't be eaten. Both were loaded with fat and gristle. In fairness, they took 50% off the steak but, frankly, that probably wasn't enough.  The meal took over an hour and a half for something that should have been served and eaten in less than an hour.  We won't be back. 
-2	We have been going to High Orchard since it opened. It's not a place you expect top end grub and service at but reasonable standards would be good.  It began reasonably well. Food was OK, service was OK and the place was, generally, OK. What you would expect from a Marstons.  Over the weeks and months, though, things have deteriorated. Our most recent visit, around the middle of August 2014, the service reached a new low and the food was barely adequate and the raucous sounds coming from one particular table spoilt any atmosphere there might have been.  To be fair to them I wrote and explained my concerns. I never do this with the intent of getting a free meal. If the standard is so bad that I feel I need to write to them then I wont be going back anyway, even for a freebie. In this instance they did in fact offer me two main and two desert course. Trouble is I was supposed to hand in a copy of the e-mail responding to my complaint and making the offer BEFORE I ordered my meal!
-2	 Anyone expecting good southern home cooking will be sorely disappointed. The chicken itself was very average, overcooked and dry, not what I was expecting from a restaurant that propertied to be experts in chicken. I can liken this to chicken on par with the hot deli counter at Tesco. The service was very slow, and the level of ambient noise from other diners was overpowering. 
-2	went 8/10/14 service ok food ok--- but over priced  went there last year had the same meal and had more on the plate very disappointed
-2	 To treat our visiting friend, we selected Riva due to its location and website information.  Unfortunetely, we were very dissapointed. The waiter informed us on ordering that there were no pizzas (in an italian themed restaurant!!), the staff did not seem to care about the customers, witnessed by them standing behind the bar talking to each other and even though they could look sttraight at us when they could see we were waiting.  The resident singer (think he had been on the Voice) was way too loud and this spoilt our evenining as we could not hear each other despite being about three tables away.  The food was not as described on the menu, I had pasta, which was supposed to have chicken a seafood in it, it had ONE prawn, which looked as if it had been in it for days and two peices of chicken.  Finally, we had to wait for about 10 minutes to pay as the managers and waiters had a malfunctioning credit card machine. There was no real attempt to ensure we were having a good evening, our comments were ignored and we felt that a potentially great evening was ruined by a lack of regard to us as customers. 
-2	 Will Not be returning. I arrived in a fairly empty restaurant and was seated promptly. We order our starters mains and drinks all in one go. Drinks and starters came quickly. Shame both our starters were tasteless. I had a baked Camembert, was like chewing rubber and worse than what you can buy ready made in Tesco. My partner had some very garlicky prawns could easily tell they were frozen totally rank. Then came the slow! After taking away our starter plates we waited a further 40 minutes for our mains, and it was not worth the wait. I had the boeuf bourguignon was terrible. Beef was tough and the sauce was completely tasteless. My other half enjoy her mussels which is why my rating is poor and not terrible. I will never attend a café rouge again. 
-2	 We'd been before and had a good evening, unfortunately, not so on this occasion. We were five; one had to send a steak back as it was dry but had been ordered medium rare; my daughter couldn't eat her burger and left it. My wife and I had indifferent vegetarian dishes. It all came with mountains of sides of chips, veg, boiled potatoes and salad. I don't normally object when there is a lot of food on the table, but it was all very unappetising and, frankly, intimidating. I'd call it pre-Jamie school meals standard stuff. For a £100 night out, not money well spent. 
-2	 We had a table for eight booked for 7.30pm, we all arrived at 7.25pm and were advised by the host at the door that there had been a terrible mistake, another party with the same name and the same number had already taken our table even though the booking had been in place for over a week and the reservation had been confirmed the night before. The host was very unhelpful, defensive of his actions and then rude and advised he couldn't seat us so we decided not to wait the and take or business elsewhere. We wont return, it's not easy finding a table for 8 people at that time of night on a Saturday evening but we did manage and had a fantastic meal at Fowlers Farm. 
-2	 We have eaten here twice before and been absolutely deighted. However when we visited last Saturday lunchtime the service was slow, the food was cold and the presentation was poor. We will give it a miss for the time being until they can sort out their obvious staffing issues. 
-2	 Went with the family for a meal and drinks.Beer was awfull London Pride Cloudy and tasted like vinegar.Run out of Lager blaming the weather.We waited for about an hour for our main course when it turned up they forgot to write mine down so another half hour wait.When it eventually turned up it was like eating a piece of leather.Never go there again 
-2	 Visited on a busy day so you would expect some slowness of service. Unfortunately the staff just seemed ill-equipped to deal with even the most simple requests. We had to ask twice for our drinks and then a further two times for water. No apologies just an &quot;all right mate I'll sort it&quot;. Not would you expect when paying Loch Fyne prices. Finally our bill was added up incorrectly as we were on the set menu. When we pointed this out we were just given &quot;yeah I'll fix it&quot;, again no apologies. Usually manners cost nothing in this case it cost them their tip and any chance of us returning. 
-2	 Recently visited this establishment, lovely location, pity about the standard of the staff. One in particular needs to make her mind up as to whether she is thinking of staying in the hospitality business.Slamming food orders down onto the tables. Saying &quot;you,ll need this&quot; a spoon for the soup.No please or thank you, no recognition as to her being there for the customer not the other way around.She requires to learn skills relevant to the hospitality business. The carvery was well illuminated but this only allowed the customers to see a number of flies in the area.The gentleman serving behind the bar was offhand and did not seem bothered whether he served me or not.I have visited this establishment in the past but am currently wondering whether I will again. 
-2	Never been here before, thought we would give it a go.  15 minutes to get a drink at the bar, by the time our food order arrived I needed a haircut as my hair had grown ! Just kidding, but it was a heck of a wait ! An hour plus, then a further half hour after we had finished the main course to get dessert.  The main courses were good, the desserts were terrible.  Would we go again?  Not a chance.
-2	 Just got back from this restaurant, where I took the family on a whim. Try something different etc. On the positive side it was beautifully located and attractively decked out, with some great decoration and furniture. Of course a nice restaurant is much more that a pleasant facade... its about quality / good value food. This is where things went wrong... undercooked rabbit, plain pasta, measly portions of McChips, and some truely sub-standard coleslaw. I was assured by the owner, rather defensively, that some restaurant critics had been recently and gave it an 'excellent' rating. I'm not a restaurant critic, but I can eat and have a few taste buds floating around myself, and my rating is a very firm POOR. Worst of all the prices were high - nothing worse than paying top dollar for poor food. Not again, not in that restaurant. 
-2	 We fancied eating fish & chips from the paper with lots of salt and vinegar and walking along the harbour front. I'm sure we picked the worst F&C shop in Bowness, I ordered a large fish, should have asked if it was cod (my mistake), when it came it was no bigger than my wifes normal size. It was thin and tough around the edges NOT cod, the chips we greasy and thin for a chip shop, and they came in a poly box not wrapped in paper so overall a big disappointment. They need to come over to the North East coast and taste what real fish & chips taste like - maybe we are spoiled over here. 
-2	 V average to poor Chinese food served v quick but orders taken by a young dame who was more interested in her mobile and can of coke than the punters needing hot chinese food to go - this place seriously needs to appraise itself of what it wants to be - some down town low end grott or turn itself into a decent chinese take away which on first hand experience and hearing from others it is def not - crack crack and get your act together folks - you are bottom of the pile in Billericay High St 
-2	 The noodles were slimey and lacked the taste that I am accustomed to so I won't go back there. I was coming off a long shift and thought of trying this one after being disappointed by the one on their back road. Sorry guys, you need to fire the chef/s or please serve fresh food otherwise you lost a Chinese fan who could have been hooked around your door cos I am just 5minutes away from you. Sorry. 
-2	 Stopped here for breakfast. The glasses for the orange juice had greasy fingerprints and lipstick marks on them, the toaster burnt the bread, croissants were burnt, the cooked breakfast featured under cooked hash browns and overcooked sausages. The food apart from that mentioned above was ok but not worth the £8.95 we paid. Good points were the all you can eat muffins and OJ but apart from that i probably wouldn't eat there again. 
-2	We found this place to be very slow service and pricey. The food was average with little variety with a poorly laid out menu. Be warned as well that they add on a 12.5% service charge on the bill. Didn't find the staff very friendly, they came across abrupt. Wouldn't go there again out of choice.
-2	 Visited this evening and ordered the two steaks and a bottle of wine for £20. The food arrived after quite a long wait and to be fair the steaks were very well cooked and overall the meal was very good value for money, however the food was cold. We were not asked after the food was delivered if it was ok nor when the plates were removed.What could have been a very good review was ruined by cold food. 
-2	we have been to the restaurant at woodborough hall over 20 times. if this had been our first visit we not have gone again .  1 when we arrived we were asked to wait at a table ,after 20 minutes we helped ourselves to menus from the bar. these were different whith one more expensive than the other   2 we were on a groupon deal with a Preseco and canapés before the meal . we had to ask for the Preseco.  3 at this stage another couple ask the employee if they were short staffed. He confirmed the other members had called in sick .  4 this became very clear that he was the only one on duty ( other than we hoped the kitchen staff.  5 the young man kept going and made a good job of the evening .  6 the food was very good other than the crispy duck starter which was warm not crispy and tough.  7 we ordered a bottle of PINO but they had run out   8 after the meal when we came to pay we were told that the lame the we had ordered was £4.00 extra each .I said we were never told . the reply was well you took the menus from the bar I would have told you if I had have given you them . .He said he had not got the authority to change the bill   9 After a wile I paid this .   I do feel that the service has gone down and I was told that only 1 member of staff was missing This therefore meens that from last time we went they have reduce the staff by 2 ----- not a good thing for service
-2	 My family and I have been regular visitors to The Heath - as Table Table - over the last few years and enjoyed some good meals there. We went with my mother-in-law as part of the celebrations for her 90th birthday and it was extremely lucky we'd planned some other things as well. As well as the décor the quality of service and the food had changed considerably. There seemed to be a minimal staff on for a Saturday evening and goodness knows what was happening in the kitchens. It took almost half an hour just to bring us drinks and almost two hours to serve our main meal. Some of the food, like my mixed grill, was fine but the chicken dishes were extremely dull and uninteresting, one meal was completely incorrect and the steak on another had to be returned. Although money was taken off the bill and a free round of drinks provided (after the bill was queried once again!), the atmosphere of what should have been a very pleasurable event was greatly reduced. The staff seemed more exhausted than genuinely apologetic and it felt as if there needs to be a major shake-up to return to previous standards. It will be a while before we return ... if ever. 
-2	 It had been a while since I had been in this weatherspoons and the food seems to have deteriorated since. I had the Wellington followed by a chocolate brownie. I hadn't executed much being cheap however I found the Wellington and the chips over cooked. The brownie I sent back as it was frozen. It was meant to be served warm. The second one was no longer frozen but hardly warm. Having had to wait for a while to speak to one and get a replacement I'd given up. I won't be back for food here. 
-2	 We love Japanese food but don't really think teppanyaki food should be classed that way. The food we had was ok - ridiculously over seasoned (salt heart attack) but that is very common in these kind of restaurants. Service was ok and atmosphere was busy enough to be just right. Overall - ok but nothing special. Not a touch on Teppanyaki in Leeds (next to Hop) or Little Tokyo for real Japanese food. 
-2	 We were seated in a very cramped table and when we asked for another table we were told that they were booked, but there were better located tables for the entire time we were in the restaurant. The food was good but we have paid less for the same quality and there were several mistakes to our what we had ordered. Went there on a recommendation so maybe we went on their off night. 
-2	Restaurant is smart but the service was really bad for the prices. Very pushy and rushed through the meal even though place was empty on a saturday night (which was strange)! Will not be going back so many better indians in South london.
-2	 We were at Jamie's on Tuesday 9th June -- I mention the specific date because the service was so very slow. This spoilt things on the whole because although we were not in a hurry you get to the point where the whole rhythm and pleasure of the meal begins to disappear as you are all looking around wondering what happened to the main course.  Three of us shared one starter of artisan bread which was very good and of course came with olive oil etc.  In some ways this was the highlight although like everything else it took a very long time to arrive.  I very much agree with the comments of other reviewers on the food who have said that although it was fairly good, or average, you do expect more, not only because of the steep prices but also because the whole ambience of the place says &quot;this is going to be something special&quot;.  It really wasn't and although there was one server who was very friendly and helpful, the other with whom we had some contact was not so good -- not very interested and to be honest a bit supercilious. I don't want to identify individual members of staff, partly because the name on the receipt is not always the actual person doing the service so it is hardly fair. In any case I think it is the whole team organisation which needs looking at -- they did seem to be struggling on that day without a sense of clear direction.  Looking at other reviews I notice that the restaurant often responds to very favourable reviews with virtually the same text each time but tends to ignore the less favourable ones.  We have had some better experiences in the past here but over the last year or so have heard from people that the food and service have declined and regrettably have to confirm this assessment. 
-2	 We decided to visit Coast 2 Coast instead of TGI Fridays (we won't make the same mistake twice) the restaurant is modern and well laid out with plenty of breathing space. We received a warm welcome on arrival from the greeter and I am afraid that's where the positives stop! My wife ordered the BBQ pulled pork wrap with sweet potato fries and myself the Lincoln BBQ deep pan pizza. On arrival the sweet potato fries on my wife's plate were stone cold at which point I brought this to the attention of the duty manager, who was apologetic and took the plate away leaving me to eat my pizza while my wife watched on foodless. My wife's meal was returned several minuets later piping hot, why couldn't this of been accomplished first time around!!! I found the crust on my deep pan pizza doughy and under cooked leaving this on the plate only finishing the topped centre of the pizza. Disappointed no one picked up on this given our prior complaint along with the fact even a small gesture of a free refill on our cokes was not offered or reproached by the manager during/after the meal, restaurant only a 3rd full at the time so couldn't of been too busy to offer 60 seconds of his time. Over all a very disappointing first vist to Coast to Coast, will be sticking to TGI's downstairs when we fancy a bite to eat during the day in the  town. 
-2	 We booked a table for a quick meal before the theatre. Upon arrival it wasn't ready. They tried to show us through to the bar, but we explained we were a little pushed for time and to be fair to them, they got us one sorted pretty quick. The food was mixed.....one dish bang average, one good, one superb, but the portion sizes are obscene!......ly small, mix that in with £14 for what looked like 2 taster measures of admittedly fine wine and season with the fact that we also ordered a couple of glasses of tap water (they bought of bottle of mineral and whacked it on the bill) and you're left with a bit of a bad taste in the mouth. Not what you expect when you're supposedly at one of Sheffield's top restaurants. I understand the importance of presentation in cooking, but felt some of the food had an air of ostentatiousness. We've eaten at all the best in Sheffield and for me this isn't anywhere remotely near the top ten. I love eating good food at good restaurants, and am reflective of that in my tips, for the first time in a long time, I left nothing. 
-2	 We attended for lunch and ordered soup as the first course. The soup arrived cold and so salty that it was impossible to drink. This was replaced by another soup, which was hot and acceptable. My wife and I ordered salads but requested no onions in the salad. My wife's salad came with such a large amount of onion that it was impossible to remove. This was replaced by another salad. However by this stage my wife had lost her appetite. Things were obviously bad. However any restaurant can make mistakes-- it is the way that management deals with the situation that is important. I felt that management went some way towards correctly dealing with the situation. The manager readily admitted the faults and tried to correct them. There also was some reduction in the final bill. Perhaps on another day things would be different.  
-2	 I was staying at the barbican city hotel and I tried here and there some places for dinner.. This one is not in my favorite list.. the staff is not the best, selection of drinks not particular good and the pizza not very tasty. The ambient is not bad. 
-2	 Poor service, forgot orders, food didn't match description on menu. Poor management and follow up with complaints. Our second time there. Will be a long time before a third visit. 
-2	 I came here a few months ago, the bar seemed about average but was fairly priced. I had the carvery and to be honest I got a lot of food for my money and there was a good variety of options and the chief was quite pleasant however that was the last pleasant person I met, the rest of the staff where rude and didn't care that you were there this is the reason I'm rating this so bad because I can't remember the last time I was treated this bad by the staff, not a single smile or hello or anything. If you just want some ok food that's cheap then this is that place. 
-2	 We stopped off here for a sandwich lunch today. The coffee was excellent but the ham salad and cheese salad sandwiches were very &quot;wet&quot; bread and tasteless. The packaging didn't have a date on which was worrying and when I asked the assistant why dates were not on the pack I was told they were made fresh daily, and even made up as and when they were needed. But in my opinion the sandwiches we ate where definitely not freshly made today. Think I will go to M&S in future for sandwiches as they are dated, fresh and definitely not &quot;wet&quot; bread. 
-2	 Popped in on way back from Brighton shopping for a lovely lunch as we have always been impressed before. We both ordered a ploughmans, and waited and waited, our order was lost so offered two free drinks... Thankyou... Food arrived eventually with additional bread, thank God as without additional bread the very boring cheese wouldn't have anything to go on...have to say though, the devils dyke beer superb...  Sadly very disappointed this time round.. 
-2	 You will imagine entering into a traditional restaurant when a lady in kimono welcome you. But nothing special here, just some fashionable sushi, far away for being called traditional sushi or sushi, and overpriced for what you get. Other options in town. 
-2	 . When I walked out after the meal, I was gob-smacked at the cost, venue and food, based on its credentials and awards, I was expecting something stunning. What I did not expect was a patched up ceiling, tables with paper wedged underneath stopping them from wobbling. When you’re paying top end prices I expect more. Sadly the food was average, it did not wow me in any way. Many people rave about this place, however, compared to some of the stunning places I have eaten this was a poor experience. I know many will disagree, but the hype will be short lived. Lunch time dinning may be different, make sure if you go you pick where to sit! 
-2	I have eaten here many times before and have always loved it great service and excellent food. Sadly this visit neither the food nor the service were up to the standards that we have previously experienced.   We chose the very good value set menu - 3 courses, £33 including a glass of wine. Nice menu and even though it is set and limited there is a great range. Risotto and Tagliatelle starters were fantastic, one of the nicest risottos we have ever had. For mains we had lamb and pork Milanese, sadly both were disappointing, the lamb was dry and the Milanese was bland and flavourless, the zucchini fritters were watery.   We didn’t have a dessert as we didn’t have time, the service was very slow and inattentive. We waited a long time after seating to order our food, bread came with the starters, plates weren’t cleared up and the dessert menus only came after 2 requests. We sat down at 730pm and at 950pm we requested the bill after 3 further request we receive s this at 1020pm. We were so disappointed and for the first time ever I declined to pay the sservice charge, our waitress then went and got the restaurant manager who returned with her and then he asked us why we were not paying the service, which was very embarrassing, we explained our reasons and he simply said it was discretionary and entirely up to up, no apology or explanation.   Shame!
-2	 Read lots of good reviews on this pub, but have to say was not impressed. Beer was good and menu varied. Actual food was poor to just ok. though servings more than adequate, however kitchen did not know how to work the microwave resulting in more that one course being sent back as not heated sufficiently. This happened on two separate visits. Examples:- lamb shank roasting on the outside by barely warm on the inside Apple and rhubarb crumble - fruit steaming but crumble still cold Chickpea and Sweet potato curry - consisted of normal potatoes and a few chickpeas - apparently due to how it was served Garlic nan - Cold 
-2	Ordered a 1/4 pounder meal and just a 1/4 chicken at 22.13. It was not busy at all. After 17 minute wait I enquired and was told to wait another 15 minutes for the chicken as it was being made 'fresh'..lame excuse. So I asked for a refund for the chicken. No apology from Khayam who served me, just a angry face
-2	Large range of ice cream flavours and interesting pink decor. Not sure if cakes were freshly made or simply defrosted products as their taste and texture appeared to suggest the latter.  Service leaves much area for improvement: dirty tables, uninterested waiting staff with no knowledge of menu items and long waiting times.
-2	Nice decor but that's where the fun stops!service average, food below average. We ordered the following: sexy fish roll (tasteless), spicy tuna roll (more like spicy tomato ketchup), soft shell crab (papery batter), scallops and monkfish (didn't touch the sides for a main dish) miso glazed sea bass (happy to say very good), desserts (no comment), coffees (cold). Total amount: £164   I'm more than happy to pay this amount for a meal worth that but this simply wasn't! &quot;Sexy fish lacks a tasty dish!.
-2	We had a meal here whilst waiting for boarding our flight. The very robotic service was sad as the views from the windows are great and entertaining. Please find your own personalities rather then text book copies! Food was ok but again not much attention needed as only travellers would eat here. Good have been so much better.
-2	 Lunch for 2 came to £56 in a cinema park in Stevenage! The meat in the burger was tiny and beers all cost £5!. 
-2	 My wife and I visited with our 2 children (3 and 6), the visit started well with a good welcome and we thought the décor in the restaurant made a nice environment. However it took a while to be asked for drinks and then even longer for them to be brought to the table. The kids menu was very good value but the main menu was very over priced for the portions and quality of food you receive, I had to request extra fries with my main because the amount it came with would have fitted in an egg cup. We also requested drinks just before our main course and these did not appear so I had to ask again. There was an issue with the children's ice creams and very little alternative was offered or any discount off the meal. Overall the service was poor and slow, which I couldn't understand seeing as there were plenty of staff in the restaurant for the number of customers, I feel they need organising much better and need to pay more attention to the tables needs. We would not be visiting again because overall it is very expensive for what you get and lack of service. Its a shame because we love Mexican food. 
-2	 Thought we would try GBK as it is fairly new in town. First problem was being given a glass with a black guey substance stuck to the outside. Second problem is that the burgers turned up...but the chips didn't. We waited a while thinking that they were on the way. They weren't. I asked about the chips and was told that they didn't know. So we started to eat the burgers because they were begining to get cold. As we nearly finished the burgers the chips arrived. The Chunky Chips were still raw in the middle so were inedible. The Sweet Potato chips looked good and one of them glistened - turns out it had some broken pieces of the bowl stuck to it. The Rosemary Chips were ok. It would have been good to have had the chips and the burgers at the same time. As we left we heard a couple at another table complaining that their chips had just arrived...but they had already finished their burgers. Looks like it's a common problem. We were given some vouchers 'for free chips next time you come in...' - I don't think so. Such an expensive disappointment. 
-2	 This burger here is greasy, you have to queue outside for a little while (defeating the point of fast food!) and expensive, about 50% more than equivalent US prices for the same thing. Plus points lots of fries and a great choice of drinks, but doesn't cover for the negatives. I visited in October, hope for their sakes things have improved!! More details here: http://loxstockandbagels.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/five-guys-london.html 
-2	 Fish was translucent and not at all nice and chunky as good cod is. Chips were very plain and average. Had good from here before (though not the very best) but tonight was a waste of £20 
-2	 A bunch of us from office went for a lunch. I was very disappointed with the portion size and the price. The food was not all that great, and the naan didn't taste freshly made. The waiter was very polite and the service ok, but overall I did not like it. I will not be going here again. 
-2	My overcooked lasagne was a throwback to British pub food from the 1970's. My colleagues Ox cheeks were similarly reheated and fatty. Neither dish was completely bad, but they were as uninspiring as the unenthusiastic service we received ( a real contrast to my recent trip to Miami, where service was usually superb). Admittedly this is establishment that is mainly known for its pizzas, but if other dishes are offered, they should be better than this, particularly given the price. The dessert donuts were a lot better, but generally it was dull and overpriced.
-2	 Used to visit here often and can honestly say it has slowly but surely deteriorated. The service remains good but the food and surroundings are poor.   Dirty cutlery, silverfish on the table and grotty toilets were three highlights from my last visit...  Shall not be returning until it improves significantly! 
-2	 Our feelings about The Sun are as mixed as the recent reviews. We stayed only a stone's throw from it's front door for a week in mid August but only eat there once after a disappointing Sunday roast; we ate in the evening and the roast potatoes were virtually inedible after being re-heated from earlier in the day. The venue itself is welcoming enough with great views from the gardens and leather sofas to sink into at the end of a long day but there are far nicer places to eat in Coniston (The Crown) and the bar staff, who should work on their people skills, need to try harder if they want to compete with the other hostelries in the village. 
-2	I've been to La Capanna quite a few times over the years (always at the behest of my parents who live locally), but always been struck by the abruptness and inattentiveness of the staff, the price, mediocre cooking and sparse portions. The last - and final - visit a friend and I were considering whether or not to have a glass of house wine each and the waiter (we thought helpfully at the time) suggested we go for a half-bottle. We did so, but he may've before told us the price: £38 + VAT. Thanks for that!
-2	 We had heard a lot about this restaurant and expected great things. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. Starters were quite nice but frankly uninspiring and very overpriced, one of the main courses was so poorly put together we had to send it back. The other one, a fish dish, was very good, and the chocolate fondant was fantastic.   Overall bland and overpriced, what a shame. 
-2	 We ate here late summer 2014 not long after the opening of this parade of restaurants facing Kingston Riverside. The location and interiors are wonderfully done but remember it's the food you go there for. The restaurant don't serve starters and only allows main courses and all food comes at once. This I suspect is to get you in/out quicker to resit the table. The food was only ok nothing special. Shame really as Kingston needs a good Thai restaurant. Changes are needed to both the menu/prices. Wines were expensive too. It's not just the setting its the food too and all other restaurants allow starters. We didn't return as of yet. 
-2	 Not much to say about this place. Being from 'up north' I was expecting a lot more from a London Italian restaurant albeit a part of a chain. Took 30 minutes before anyone came over to ask about drinks (restaurant wasn't busy) then when the food came the pizza I ordered was quite bland. The kids had spaghetti bolognese which was only sauce with no meat. The tables around the area where we were sat were very close together and when leaving I basically had to slide my backside along someone else's table while they were eating which I'm sure added to ambiance of their visit. 
-2	 We had a table booked for 9.30pm on a Saturday night, was seen to our table well past 10pm, food was of very poor quality, we ordered a set mixed grill for two which cost £37 and consisted of chicken and lamb sish, we had to ask for the other items, i.e. ribs, etc. we were still finishing our food when they decided to turn the lights off. I would not go back there especially when you have the other Turkish restaurant just around the corner. The restaurant cannot cope with the shear amount of people 
-2	 wife and I went at 3p.m so we could leave before 5 p.m,otherwise you pay £13.99 for the evening sitting.im glad I didn't pay the extra for the below average food. I mean when has Cheap cocktail sausages in sauce ever made it on to a Chinese menu before?!!! I loved the fresh chicken tikka and chillies,my wife was able smile and get an off menu pasta sauce one chef for her first plate. next plate,new chef ,unable to add ingredients not described for that dish,but were in front of him for other sauces.how frustrating? Grill chef took Piri Piri chicken out of fidge to reheat ,so you have to wait around instead of them having a whole tray ready for me to choose which ones I wanted form a buffet. Dessert plenty choice ,help yourself ice cream machine was best bit! 
-2	 Ordered the burger which came garnished with mustard and onions according to the menu, not ideal but thought I'd give it a go. First bite found top of bun smothered in ketchup as well as mustard, so put that to one side. No real problem. Second bite found bottom of bun also smothered in ketchup and mustard, so couldn't eat that either. Pointed this out to waitress but was told they can't put everything on menu description and that was that! Very disappointed with outcome but in a rush to go elsewhere, so rather than make a scene, won't eat there again. 
-2	 It's a while since we've been to the Guildford branch of Bill's. It should have been a good choice again.....but it wasn't.  We had Gill's 6 year-old nieces with us, having just enjoyed a Christmas outing to see The Nutcracker at The Electric Theatre. We wanted to give them a decent afternoon tea/early supper, but wanted something lighter ourselves.  The best thing about this place is the location. Sadly it all went downhill as soon as we walked in.  It wasn't very busy, but it still took a little while to greet and seat us.  We ordered a fixed price 3 course meal for the girls. A healthy starter of hummous with carrot & cucumber sticks was ok. Then they admitted they had lost the main course order. So quite a long wait again....  Gill and I had toasted tea-cakes. My generous pot of tea was almost cold by the time they arrived. They were ok, but a bit soggy and may have been waiting around almost as long as we had been.  The girls had fish fingers, chips & peas and spaghetti & meatballs, with some strangely charred ciabatta or garlic bread.  Another wait for their chocolate brownie and ice cream.  The staff were apologetic about the wait. The manager kindly dropped by to see us, and - unbidden - adjusted the bill. There was a party for 30 people going on in the crypt downstairs, but it was quiet upstairs and they should have been able to cope.  All in all, a very disappointing - and slow - experience, I'm afraid. It used to be much better when they were newer. I believe the chain is closing in on 100 restaurants now, after humble beginnings in Sussex just 15 years ago. There's talk of it being acquired by venture capitalists for up to £100m. Cote in Guildford is following a similar trajectory but seems to be providing both better and more consistent food and service levels.  Always a danger of over-expanding, I guess.... 
-2	 Overall very mediocre food. The prices for the “types” of dishes I ordered were typical. Traditionally chicken tikka would come sizzling on a hot plate. When it arrived It wasn’t which was very disappointing, as the waiter assured me that it would. Of the dishes I ordered, the vegetable dishes were OK, but the rest of the meal was very disappointing. The staff were very polite, attentive and friendly. I’ve given two stars as I was told it was a &quot;great&quot; restaurant. 
-2	 Nice atmosphere, but the food and service are not great. The house wine is really poor, and the cakes taste as if they have been made on an industrial scale. The place tries to offer to many dishes to too many people, but can't quite deliver what it sets out to do. 
-2	 Booked a table for 6 people. Starters where ordered and were OK. I ordered a chicken dish on a bed of risotto. They brought me Duck!. Sent it back and eventually it arrived, just as the rest of the party were finishing there meals.What did arrive was a roasted chicken leg on top of a mound of rice, the chicken leg was dry, hard and overcooked.The rice was no better, that was so hard It was like eating sand. I couldn't eat the food and complained to the waitress, she apologised and said it was a new menu.The bill came and they had charged for the chicken dish, not cheep £16.I refused to pay and it was removed from the bill. Will never return to this restaurant / bar. Funny thing is it was my idea to go there in the first place. 
-2	 My wife and I visited the restaurant on a weekday in early August as we have been fans of this hotel for many years and our daughter's wedding reception was held there. Following a major refurbishment we were really looking forward to a great evening out. What a huge disappointment. We were ignored by the staff when we arrived, we were served champagne without even a peanut to accompany it let alone a canape. The starter was a rip off - 3 pieces of asparagus, one quails egg and a dollop of hollandaise. In contrast the main course was huge but unbalanced. We declined a dessert as just ice cream was £8. The piped music was awful and the wrong coffee served - put right but after waiting over 15 minutes. I wrote a long letter to the General Manager the next day and 6 weeks later I have not even had the courtesy of an acknowledgement let alone an explanation. Regretttably, this is now a place to avoid. 
-2	 Our visit didn’t live up to TripAdvisor expectations. Possibly just caught it on a bad night, but our party of 8 where decidedly under whelmed.  To start, we all had poppadoms and dips which were fine. We ordered beers (hand pull) which were just to say drinkable IMO (big fan of proper real ale) Others agreed it wasn’t top ale. Especially considering we were drinking only a few hundred meters from the brewery. One of our party ordered a larger, the waiter went off to the bar but came back empty handed and said the larger is off. However, he said the Stella was on. Confused our man said OK I’ll have one of them then. The waiter returned with Stella Cider!  In between courses I went to visit the gents. I noticed the waiter in there too. Sadly he’d finished what he was doing and went straight out missing the wash basin, which set off alarm bells in my head.  When the main course eventually arrived (heck of a delay between courses) I had a Chicken Tikka Masala. A classic curry house dish which I figured was a safe bet. I was disappointed. It was very sickly sweet and salty which wiped out any flavours. I just couldn’t eat it all.  Clearly others posting on TripAdvisor site have had a much better experience. Maybe the inside-a-pub curry house just can’t cope with a party of 8 or more (even tho’ we were the only ones sat down to eat) which is a shame because the concept ticks all the boxes! Alas only one or two in our party said they enjoyed it. The following day a few of us felt a little loose shall we say. That could have been the beer to be fair, but who knows. Disappointing curry night out... Won’t be going back. 
-2	 I've always had mixed feelings about Gazette. Having lived in Balham for 3 years I wanted it to be a great French restaurant but time after time I've been disappointed. This time was the last straw.  Let's start on a positive note. The new restaurant looks great. But I'm afraid that's where it ends.   We arrived 15mins late through no fault of our but they had already given our table away! They made no effort to call us (despite having my number) nor did they answer the phone when I tried 3 times to warn them we were running a little late. It took 20mins to be given another table; one that had been empty the entire time we were there! Did they apologise.....absolutely not.  Next up, the food. We ordered mussels to share. They were dry, over cooked and didn't taste fresh at all. For a French restaurant, this should be a decent staple dish. Avoid!   We then had the chateaubriand steak for 2, asking for it to be cooked medium with pepper sauce and to replace the chips with dauphinoise potatoes. It arrived decidedly rare with bearnaise sauce and chips. To rectify the steak they just put the now already sliced meat on the grill, drying it out completely. The potatoes then arrived 15mins later by which time the rest of the food was cold.   Did not offer to take anything off the bill other than the service.....NON!  I could go on but I think you get the gist! This is a v poor French restaurant that I desperately wanted to be good. In the future, we'll head to Wandsworth Common where both Cafe du Village and Bellevue Rendez-Vous serve much better food for less. 
-2	 I have used this restaurant a few times and have nothing negative to say about the quality of food. However a few weeks back i attempted to have a table for 2 on a Saturday night at 11pm, we were turned away and told that the kitchen had closed. I was a little suprised but thought fair enough no problem.   So this weekend i thought ill try my luck again with my parents too but get in earlier to avoid dissapointment. Saturday 10.20pm on the dott i walked through the door and asked for a table for 4, after the waiter scrunched up his face for a second whilst he thought about an answer to give me he said 'its take away only', i turned around and left the building.   Now im no business man but id of thought Fri/Sat night would be prime time for people to sit down and enjoy indian cuisine so to turn people away at 10.20pm Do they not need the money? Had they planned an early finish?  Dissapointed 
-2	 Had lunch today extremely disappointed with today's special Jacket potato returned it as it was cold only for meal to be reheated which made Jacket potato horrid. Will not be returning in a hurry. 
-2	 Firstly the decor is something out of the 1970's and hasn't been touched since then. Service at the bar was average, they kept shouting to the kitchen to find out what was on and available - at 7.00pm! Waitresses were first class, friendly and attentive, sadly not backed up by the kitchen. I ordered Steak and otter ale pie, veg and spuds all piping hot but unimaginative, cut into the pie and it was still cold inside. Waitress immediately replaced it with a new serving, pie was hot this time but completely stodgy and dry. If we were served food like this at home in the Peak District the place would be empty, they are saved by tha captive Hotel trade. Come on, pull your fingers out, bring the place and the menu into the 2010's you have already had a hygiene scare in 2015, I don't want to be the next person in hospital. Sadly, I have to frequent the hotel for business and it is either put up with this place or drive elsewhere which I don't always want to do. 
-2	 We came to the Sheldon after confusing the hotel with the harvester. The food was horrible! We had the Sunday carvery, the meat was red!! The mash was watery and the potatoes were small and poor in quality. We were sat on seats which were low to the ground whilst our table was high and we literally had to stretch to get our food...   Service was ok 
-2	 We went last night for a birthday celebration and a table was booked for 11 people for 7.30 pm .We all arrived on time on the restaurant was not that busy,after 15 mins our drink order was taken and after 30 mins popadums were placed on the table. 1:30 hours later I had to ask where our starters were as was told they would be on with us soon. Some of the starters were returned as they were cold on the inside.The main course was also the same with some of the order being cold when placed on the table. Finally we finished the meal and asked for the bill which was well over £200 pound, we were given a discount for the service but to be honest we get discount from a lot of Indian restaurants any way with better service. Personally I would not visit this place again, food was nothing to write about really and the service well disgraceful. 
-2	 I do love their piri-piri chicken, which is very tasty and cooked so that the chicken is still moist.  However, I ordered a delivery last night at 19:21 and was told that it would take between 30-45 minutes. Over an hour later, no sign of delivery so I rang and told it would be &quot;15...max 20 minutes&quot;.  The driver showed up 25 minutes after that call (2105). Total wait time = over 1 hour and 40 minutes.  While I appreciate that delivered can't always be immediate, I expect that businesses to give me an honest evaluation of how long something will take. Telling me 30-45 minutes and eventually delivering in 1 hour 40 minutes is simply not acceptable.  There was no apology on the phone when I rang up to chase nor from the delivery driver. Some other businesses I've had deliveries from would have also thrown in a freebie or two as a small gesture.  If I had known from the start, then I wouldn't have placed the order and gone somewhere else, but they were obviously still hoping to take my money by being dishonest. Note that this is why my 'value' rating is so low, as I placed greatest value in getting my food in a reasonable timeframe.  Maybe I would go back for some takeaway, but never again will I try to use them for delivery. 
-2	Me and my friend went to Red Hot in Mancester last wednesday. We waited 10 minutes until we were seated, another 30 min until we were able to order the drinks and another 10 untill they arrived to our table after a reminder to the manager. I would come back for the food, but the service quality makes me think about it.  I have to say I've been in other restaurants of the same company and the service and the food was much better.
-2	 Went here a few months back, and the food was over priced in contrast to the portions, me and my partner were there for about 2 hours and the waiter, asked us if we can hurry up as they needed the table. Which kind of ruined the mood, so we left soon after that.  Not much choice for vegetarians either, but nice deco in the restaurant.  There are much better mexican restaurants near Covent garden, i would recommend you try those instead. 
-2	 Four of us went here for Sunday lunch. This is a local pub with lots of atmosphere and locals coming in for a drink. They offer a sunday lunch menu with a choice of starters and two main courses.The starters we ordered were ok - scotch egg, melted cheeze on broccoli and houmous. The main courses were awful - the Rib of Beef turned out to be large thick wedges of rubbery meat which we were unable to cut, even with a serrated knife, thrown on top of tasteless soggy roast potatoes and an awful lump of cardboard which looked like a yorkshire pudding. One of us ordered the chicken which I am told was 'not brilliant'. We told the waitress who said that her manager would offer us free desserts. We chose ice cream which was good. They were busy - perhaps they were having a bad day? The quality of the meat was inexcusable and they need to change their butcher but maybe also their chef? I haven't had such a bad meal for a long time. 
-2	 The early dinner menu has moved from 7.00 to 6.30. However at 6.20 we had to ask specifically for this menu as it was not offered by the waitress. Starter of spring vegetables with a poached egg couldn't have been better. Lightly crunchy veg. and a soft egg. Main course of Beef Provencale was an utter disappointment. Though nicely presented, the meat and its 'sauce' had little flavour.Boiled beef and carrots in a local caff would have had more taste. One piece of meat was inedible gristle. The carrots were cooked well. Dessert of strawberry fool was ok, nothing special. Merlot d'Oc was disappointing. Although we were asked if the starter was good , no-one asked about the main course. Did the waiting staff know that it was poor ? My previous meal at Blancs was in Bath .Passable ...just. There seems to be an increasing disjunct between the enthusiastic M.Blanc on the telly and the restaurants that bear his name. 
-2	 I have just got back from The Gate Hangs Well which is situated in a lovely spot. There ends the positives. I went with my 3 children. On arrival inside the pub I was ready to turn and walk straight back out because it was empty apart from a few locals in the bar area. This was 7pm Thursday night. The decor is very very tired and dirty. We were the only ones in the dining part of the pub which was also very shabby and had seen better days, the table we sat at was sticky to touch. It was a shame because I am sure with a lick of paint and a lot of elbow grease the place could be half decent.The food also was over priced for the quality and quantity of it.  In summary I would not recommend it and will not be going back. 
-2	 we have been going to this harvester since it opened some 20 yrs ago. the time has come to say no more! the place is a complete tip, theres more food,rubbish on the floors and tables than there is outside in the road. the tables are not cleaned properly and are sticky along with the menus which do not want to touch ! im sure its all part of their cost saving schemes since they have the cheapy menus they  now offer. the waitresses seem to be rushed off their feet serving,taking orders,getting people their drinks and on top of that they are expected to clean not only the tables but the floor as well ive never seen so much debris(on the floors, food ,cutlery,gen.rubbish) any where else ever! this use to be a treat for our family when we first started going there but they have cut back on everything to cover the cost of the cheap menus,staff,portions,food quality ,hygene,decor,wages dont think ive seen a manager in there for years you get what you pay for !! enough said 
-2	 Although an attractive restaurant, with friendly and helpful staff, my meal was very disappointing considering the price. I had a fillet steak which was cooked well, but without any seasoning and served as a lump in the middle of a plastic plate which resembled an old worn chopping board. No garnish, no vegetables just a tin bowl of deep fried thin cut chips which consisted mainly the last knockings of the bag, the tiny scrappy overlooked bits which I usually throw out rather than serve. When I brought these to the attention of our waiter he recognised the problem and offered to replace them. Unfortunately the replacements took at least 10 mins and arrived after my meal was finished. The 'crunchy' side salad was just a handful of rocket with one cherry tomatoes cut in two with a dressing ....inadequate, not fitting the description and overpriced at £3.50. My friend had the Venison Ragu wrapped in pasta which I have to say was delicious and served with spinach and squash. Although I had complained and was offered tea or coffee on the house, which I refused, no further offer was made to recompense me for my inconvenience. Having paid over £27 for my steak, I would have expected it to be accompanied with some kind of vegetable or trimmings and served with a little more flair. The fact that the cutlery was also dirty and had to be replaced really just summed up a very disappointing experience. Having eaten recently in Tramshed in London, perhaps I made the mistake of thinking Cowshed might be of a similar standard but clearly I was mistaken, they are not in the same league . 
-2	 Have visited many times for buffet menu, had a wide choice, not any more! Advertised outside @ £9.95 is in fact £15.00, sweets now priced over £5.00 even for 3 scoops of ice cream, will not return. 
-2	 We have eaten at this pub many times and have used it when entertaining for business. Not sure why but on yesterday's visit it was almost empty and had gone do far downhill.   It was almost self service. Up to the bar to order then chase staff for sauces. There was no check we were happy.      There was no checking we were happy and the 
-2	 The food was good enough, nay, passable at best, but the bloody tables were absolutely filthy. I don't know what kind of cleaning and hygiene schedule this place is running but all the trimmings and fixtures were very mucky. Also my omelette was far too moist. 
-2	 What should have been a lovely meal was ruined by extremely slow service. The poor waitresses had to pacify a lot of frustrated diners. Apparently the management had left for the evening and they blamed a recent change in menu/management for the drop in service. The pub has recently had an extension built but clearly can't cope with demand.  I hope they sort themselves out soon, as the view from the pub is amazing. We won't make the effort to return though 
-2	Avoid the carvery - dry meat, nuked veg, parsnips turned to stone. Tasteless and a well below average meal. Been a few times and always leave disappointed.  It's had a recent refit and staff are friendly, but I'm after more than that from a meal out!
-2	 We are local to the area and took visitors to Winston's for Fish & Chips -- Very expensive and even the OAP Special was not that cheap. - I believe that new owners have recently took over ( Not the previous people were any cheaper ) There are many more reasonably priced eateries in the area. 
-2	It's OK, that's all you can really say about the place. Far too many children running around unsupervised for my liking.  Far better venues very nearby, so walk past this one would be my advice.
-2	 I should add to that unhelpful at times. We were elated with having just completed up at the O2. We want we want a nice drink and some nibbles to keep us going before dinner. The drink when I ordered was my Great difficult when consumed pretty great taste.  The food on the other hand seemed to get lost in the jungle. In the end it was only by going on Safari managing to find a ranger that it was retrieve for us. The food turned out to be actually quite tasty - the calamari was very spicy and the chicken wings perfectly grilled as requested, but the nachos lacked the promising accompaniments advertised.   
-2	 Went in here because Tayyabs was full. Not very happy with our impromptu choice. Filo pastries were soggy. Lamb chops were tough and chewy. And the stuffed aubergine was bland and tasteless. The mains weren't terribly cheap either at £11+. On top of that the food gave me stomach cramps all night. Will definitely NOT be going back there. 
-2	 If you're a real foodie, weigh less than 8 stone and have huge amounts of money to spray around then this is the restaurant for you! I eat in a lot of restaurants during my business and social life. I am just as happy with a fillet steak or a Chinese take-away. I was lucky enough to be taken for lunch at The Square but couldn't have been more disappointed. The restaurant itself is packed with staff and very rich looking diners, but suffered from poor service and was totally up itself. I ordered the mackerel starter and cod main course hoping they would be delicious but not too large. I shouldn't have worried about the size as I could have eaten both courses in approx 6 mouthfuls & I've only got a medium sized mouth. I did admittedly choose the set lunch menu, but was left severely wanting... I ended up buying a pack of crisps on the way back to the office to fill the gap! Definitely won't go back. Suggestion, try the Pollen Street Social... similar price but infinitely superior in terms of service and food 
-2	 Two of us went on a Friday night it was pretty busy and were told it would be a 40 minute wait. An hour later and no food so we asked one of the waitresses who came back to tell us that it was because they were busy but it was being done now. Another 20 minutes on and still nothing we spoke to several people and eventually were told our food had been given to another table. 2 hours from when we ordered we got our food which was average and not very hot. We were told we would be given a refund but even then had to root out the manager ourselves in order to get it. Will never go here again which is a shame as the Bradmore Arms in the same chain is nothing like it and is so much better! Will stick to going there instead. 
-2	 The badger was an okay restaurant wasn't my favourite but the food was pleasant and you couldn't really complain. The service was standard and as I said before the food was pleasant but standard as well. The best thing about the badger was the interior design inside, it looked great the next time I come down to Newcastle I hope the food and the service reaches the standard of the interior design. The place overall is standard and I doubt I will be visiting the badger again. 
-2	 Nothing to complain about the food, it is great for reasonable prices. I always order take away and the experience is better than visiting. What struck me: they really rush you through the service in order to sell the table again. Even worse: we were not allowed to order dessert because we were longer then 1.5 hours in the restaurant. I appreciate the business sense however they should announce this when being seated. In short: don't go if you want to take your time to enjoy dinner. 
-2	 Shortly after this restaurant opened we had lunch here and on the basis of this and the subsequent very good reviews on trip advisor we returned for dinner. We were very disappointed – my rating is based on this experience, I would rate it 4 for a quick sushi lunch. A pity because the main reasons for our disappointment would be easy to fix – very much in order: the way the food is served, the ambiance of the upstairs room and the front door. The food itself is on average good, some very good.  My wife ordered one dish from the starter list (tempura) and a main (teriyaki) which obviously should have been served as two courses. I ordered the sashimi set (tempura; sashimi/sushi; salad; miso soup) which would normally be served as either 3 or 4 courses, but given my wife’s order I though may have been served as two. But everything came together. Apart from when one orders a bento box I have never experienced this before in any of the Japanese restaurants I have eaten in, either in the UK or Japan. It felt more like eating lunch in a works cafeteria than a relaxing dinner in a restaurant.  Not surprisingly, having eaten the tempura – which was both large and hot straight from cooking – my wife’s teriyaki and the accompanying rice were cold (obviously not a problem for my sashimi/sushi or salad!). She asked for it to be reheated, which it was, and commented on being surprised it had come with the starter, but did not receive any response to that from the waiter – but did from the adjacent table who said they had the same problem. By the time I got to my soup (which in a Japanese meal should come after the main course) that was also cold, but by that time we had had enough and could not be bothered to complain again.  As for the food itself – the sashimi and sushi were very good; the tempura was good, if a little greasy; but the teriyaki was swimming in far too much thin marinade and the meat of variable quality – of course the reheating may not have helped in this.  We ate in the upstairs room which felt sterile, being furnished only with the tables and chairs and with plain walls – albeit with picture window blinds. The tables were well spaced and a few large pot plants between them to break it up, for example, would have helped the ambiance. Downstairs is better. One final irritation is that the front door gave a mighty bang as it shut every time anyone arrived or left – even upstairs it was very loud and seemed to shake the building.  So if you do go to this restaurant for dinner I suggest you ask for a table downstairs and explicitly say that you want each course served separately. If you want Japanese food you need to travel a bit to find an alternative, but if you just want a relaxing meal why take the risk – there are plenty of other places to eat in Epsom. 
-2	My girlfriend made a booking as a treat off of the back of a recommendation from one of her colleagues. She heard the food was great and reviews were good, especially the happy hour menu.   Upon arriving the look of the outside made me a bit hesitant however we continued on in anyway. We wasn't greeted very warmly however we were shown to our table. We arrived at around 9:15pm on the understanding that the last seating was at 10:30pm.   We were offered drinks by the older waiter who appeared very grouchy and abrupt. Glasses on the table were dirty with greasy finger prints from the servers so avoided any wine and water and just asked for soft drinks in which I can only hope were given to us in clean glasses.   Because i'd noticed the happy hour menu in the windows as we went in but could not find it anywhere in the menus we were given I got up to take a look at it. As I read through it the older waiter came over to me to see what the problem was, in which I simply asked what time the menu ended. He abruptly stated we should have arrived before 8pm if we wanted that menu. Fair enough we arrived after the menu had ended but I was just curious for future visits.  Don't worry I do have some positive feedback for this waiter. He then came to take our orders, after he took them I thanked him and I believe I did catch a small grin but it was too quick to take a photo...sorry. Normal service then resumed as that was the last we saw of our waiter. Food was delivered and then that was the last we saw of any server.  We arrived late due to work commitments and agreed it may be for the best to avoid any noisy children, instead the environment was disrupted by a table of noisy big kids. This may not bother some and you may feel has no reflection on the restaurant but did dampen our experience as the loud and frequent cackle of tipsy women around a couldr...I mean table, meant conversation for a couple such as ourselves was difficult. The restaurant is small so any couple looking for a more intimate meal will not get on with the slightly larger group tables here.  The food we ordered arrived very quickly, and was tasty. I can't say it was amazing as tasted much the same as any other chinese/cantonese restaurant or takeaway we have ordered from in the past. Food was hot, tasted how I expected, and was adequately portioned.  After we finished our meal we sat there for a good 15-20mins before deciding to get up to leave at around 10:10pm. No offer of coffees, desserts or even the bill even though other servers were looking over at us, they just seemed to ignore our table. We walked over to the bar on the way out and paid our bill there.  Overall very disappointing. Food was good so guess we could recommend the takeaway to collect but its nothing special when compared against any other local takeaway. With the noisy environment and the table service basics that were clearly missing during this particular visit we could not recommend making a booking here for any kind of occasion.
-2	 We went to No 5 Bridge Street for a Sunday dinner and were very disappointed with the experience. We were told that the beef had run out and offered lamb instead (fair enough) but weren't thrilled when we were charged £3 per head more for this, despite it not being specified on the menu, or, for that matter, mentioned by the (fairly useless) waitress. The service, given the fact that the restaurant was virtually empty, was geologically slow -- we were waiting for 25 minutes after our plates were taken away before we gave up on the waiting and went to the bar to pay. The food, to be fair, was very nice; however, we shan't be going back. 
-2	 Called for lunch early April and the place was packed inside and out. When we went inside this pub seemed too rough and ready for our liking. It must have something to offer by the number of people there but the pub further up the road was more to our taste. 
-2	 Ir was not bad until today.  The chicken breast was full of oil. They did not dry it a bit. Straight from the fryer to the box. 
-2	 We've eaten here quite often and I've given a good review before, even describing this as our favourite Nando's. On our last two visits the staff were friendly and polite and the food was good.  However, about a month ago, after ordering I picked up two plates along with the cutlery, as we were sharing a platter. The top two plates were really dirty and the one underneath wasn't much better. In case anyone wonders, this was a pile of plates that were supposed to be clean, not one of used crockery. I told a member of staff, who brought clean plates to our table. On our latest visit, two days ago at lunchtime, the crockery was ok, but the first 3 knives I pulled from the container all had remnants of food stuck to them. Again, a member of staff I spoke to replaced the offending items quickly. The restaurant had only been open for an hour and wasn't busy, so it's not as though the staff were too rushed off their feet to check the cleanliness of items that customers would be eating with. There's no excuse for paying poor attention to hygiene and, after this second experience, I will have second thoughts about using this Nando's again. 
-2	 My wife and I called in here for lunch and really wish we hadn't. The carpet was worn so badly in two places on the stairs that the concrete underneath was beginning to crumble. The gents smelled disgusting and had a dirty, shabby appearance. There was food all over the floor (I pointed this out to a member of staff and it was mostly cleared up about ten minutes later). The worst thing of all though was when my meal was served with the cutlery, the knife was encrusted with dried food and appeared not to have been washed. The only good point was that the waiter had the sense to pass my complaint on to a manager who came to our table and apologised. She also offered us a free drink - which we accepted. We were informed that the pub would be re-furbished soon. Let's hope they do something about the hygiene at the same time. Incidentally, I reported this on the company's web site but they have, so far, neither replied nor acknowledged my complaint. 
-2	 The real problem was not the waiter, who was really embarrassed, but the kitchen who delayed preparing one of our parties meals by nearly 20 minutes so she effectively had to eat alone. Very disappointing. 
-2	 I mean it was fish and chips, it tasted good, it was greasy, but at the end of the day it was fish and chips, if you like fish and chips this would be a good place to visit, I'd give the fish and chips a 6/10 (haddock by the way!11!, cod may be a different ball park) ordered for takeaway so didn't have to deal with staff extensively, they seemed like cool dudes tbh smh at the people in the restaurant they all looked gutted sat their waiting 4 fish like wastemen tbh, their website stated the restaurant was not takeaway, but i rang them and it was so uknofam not too useful and that could be done better, in conclusion if u like fish and chips give it a shot, if you don't like fish and chips why are you even reading this review you WASTEMAN don't go here they literally just serve fish and chips i imagine the other dishes on the menu are like a solid 2/10 max i mean chilli jam really??//? jam is for like strawberries and tings you get me JME, dogs would enjoy leftovers as a side note, i don't haev a doge but im just guessing i mean i was expecting it to be a solid 11/10 seeing as its renowned and that but at the end of the day fish and chips is fish and chips, what more could you be expecting fam, if you came here expecting gourmet cuisine you're the wasteman not the restaurant staff, don't get up in their grill they're just honest fam making honest fish n chips so just don't hate you know. tbh smh that they're intruding on local business, but i mena i guess aggregaet demand is all the same and that so it doesn't really matter, best of luck to them but i mean there's like 17 hairdressers on eccy road ( i counted ) so like idk if people really go there for fish and chips especially when theres an actually half decent restaurant next door, harry randoms seems like its trying to fill a niche for up market fish and chips which just simply doesn't exist in this climate, its just FOOLISH. 
-2	 This was recommended in the Guardian, so was looking forward to a good value for money meal as highlighted by them. We were a grown up family and all expert at home cooking so we do know how this works.   Basically, this is expensive tapas which can be had for much better value only a few doors away. Two of us opted for the gross out headline dish of the aged beef rib at £55 to share. Some of this was ok, but some of the outer meat was burnt and tough, not what we expected for the money! My son had the chicken skewers which tasted somewhat fishy - I suspect because they used the same grill for the fish dishes too. Overall the standard of service was up to speed, but oh the door, which we were next to( it's quite small inside!) kept giving us an Arctic blast every time it opened. And the bench seat against the wall we we sat at not in any way comfortable. Cold and achy are not good bedfellows! In fact, a lot of the seating was of the bar stool variety- high and with no backs.   Was the steak worth it at £55 a pop, you will ask? Not in my book. I have had much better quality for less dosh. 
-2	 Reasonable beer and plenty of choice of tables for a quiet drink. Staff friendly. As we did not eat cannot comment on that aspect. We last visited this pub some 8 years ago, when it had a better name. 
-2	 I came here for the first time with a small group (6 in total) of friends all of whom had been before, and spoke very highly of Graffiti. I'm afraid on last night's showing I can't share their enthusiasm.  We arrived at 8 for a drink before our reservation at half past. Around half past, someone came to say that the previous sitting was still at our table. Fair enough, these things happen. It got to 9, and we'd not had an update, so one of our party went to enquire; about quarter past the manager (I presume) came to say that he was very sorry but the table still wasn't clear; so we opted to eat in the orangery instead. He said he'd get a table laid up for us. At this point, we asked for menus as none had been offered. They then took our order pretty quickly, and said that one of the two bottles of wine we'd ordered would be on the house.  We got to our substitute table around 9.30 (so an hour after our booking), and our starters finally appeared around 9.50. By this point, the red wine was on the table, but not opened, and the white wine hadn't appeared at all. We asked for this to be resolved, but by the time the white wine finally arrived, I'd already finished my starter (which was the Shanghai rissotto, the only course I'd wanted white wine with!). Our mains followed reasonably swiftly, but it then felt like we were rather forgotten, and waited a long time to be asked if we wanted dessert; and then our dessert drinks arrived quite some time before the desserts themselves.  My starter was OK, but not exciting (my friends really liked the venison tartare, though), and my main was an entirely competent rib-eye steak. My dessert &quot;Chilli Chocolate Mousse, Passion Fruit Curd, Jersey Cream&quot; was dissapointing - a dry bit of brownie, some chocolate ice-cream, and a nice enough passion-fruit sauce. Not a hint of chilli, and hardly a mousse. My wife loved the pumpkin pudding, though, and the cheese board went down well with my friend who had that.  I should say that all the staff we interacted with were friendly and professional, but too many things were wrong - we should have been kept up-to-date with the delay on our table without asking, the wine should have arrived on time, we shouldn't have been forgotten in the orangery. 
-2	 Staff were friendly but this did not make up for the poor quality food. We don't want posh food all the time but it really was not particularly nice and we paid far more than it was worth. Noisy environment and the sofas that are seats at many tables at the edges of the room are really dirty. 
-2	 We decided to take a trip to this restaurant as it was the only one of the 5 Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants that we had not visited in the Esher, Claygate and Esher area...We had been to the previous restaurant on this site 'The Bengal Lancer' quite some years ago. There is little question that this has a beautiful interior and is incredibly spacious - plus the location is pleasant. Staff were quite friendly, albeit, a little disorganised - the music was far too loud and intrusive, frankly. The food was totally fine, yet incredibly unremarkable at quite a higher price.  For example - the Madras was far too hot (hotter than the atypical Vindaloo) - and was too 'thin' and 'oily' - it was more about 'heat' than flavour, THEN heat.  We felt it was a pity - as with a higher standard of cuisine, (plus, as this restaurant is unique in its internal aesthetics and size) - it DOES have potential - yet sadly - frankly - the food is quite some way, inferior, to the 2 restaurants in Esher (Panahar and Esher Tandoori), the Rasoy in Claygate Parade and the Panshi in Hinchley Wood. It's unquestionably the weakest. We would return, however, only to see if other dishes are better - and we try not to make a permanent, 'definitive' opinion on a restaurant based on a solitary average meal. 
-2	 The food was ok but nothing special. A bit pricy for what there was. Atmosphere a bit impersonal. We were sat at a table apart from the others and felt a bit isolated. Will not be going back. 
-2	 The mystery of the disappearing staff goes on. There were plenty staff a minute ago when there was nobody at the bar, I thought looking bemused. Now a crowd of people are standing waiting for service and it's as if they've been abducted by aliens leaving one very hard working, but clearly losing the battle, girl to take the flack. Shouts in to the back for help go either unanswered or get a reply that they're busy. I look through square hatch to my left to see 2 staff talking and another collecting glasses at a snail's pace. More people arrive. Girl is heading to meltdown. Students arrive and talk about doing bombs but Dave needs to get cashback. I've long since been served and hurry my drink down because I can't watch it any more. It's like seeing plane with all it's engines on fire plummeting towards earth. Meanwhile the glasses are all nicely loaded in to the dishwasher so it can't be all that bad can it? 
-2	 Had a very nice pint but both of us had sandwich but had to leave over half of it but service was friendly 
-2	 We went here last night for a friend's leaving do. The restaurant was half empty and we had booked a table for 8 people 3 days in advance. Despite this we were kept waiting for ages to order drinks, then kept waiting again for at least 20 minutes for the drinks to come and food to be ordered. Then we were kept waiting again before the food came. The manager offered us a free round of drinks which never showed up. After more than 2 hours we had had 1 drink and our main course. Upon complaining repeatedly and even more waiting for the bill we eventually got 75% off of the bill as some recompense. We had to laugh when we first got the bill and a service charge was added! We were all given vouchers as well, I may use them for a different branch but this particular one I will NEVER return to! It was a good thing we weren't going to a film or anything. After leaving we went to another bar and had 8 drinks made, bought and paid for in under 10 minutes by 1 guy on his own at the bar compared to 5 at Chiquitos! 
-2	 I visited Flames with a friend back in May, and I was slightly disappointed. There was chicken in one of the vegetarian dishes which shocked me, being vegetarian. Even though it must have been dropped in there, it was there for a while.  I felt as though one of the staff members were constantly watching me and my friend which made us feel uncomfortable. Negatives aside, everything else was fairly decent. 
-2	 Enjoyed the food, nice ambience and there was enough well trained and pleasant serving staff. However, the service from the kitchen was so very slow 50min wait for our main course I was informed there was a run on pasta dishes (what a surprise for an Italian restaurant) hence the delay? It is quite expensive for the type of food offered so there should be no excuse for such poor service. 
-2	 Went with a large group and were heavily overcharged by the management who refused to reimburse merely because some people drank rather that &quot;ate&quot; after they had mis-calcuated the number of our patrons each if whom had paid individually on exit. Recommend you pay on entering. Management will not rectify mistakes and seem to regard most patrons as potentially dishonest. I had a horrible costly experience 
-2	 Food generally ok and the price wasn't bad. Disappointed that I paid extra for a King Prawn Saag and got normal prawns.  Usually a good place to eat. 
-2	 Interior date.looks grub.Staff friendly.fish not to clever. However Chinese menu is good and plenty Recommended stir beef 
-2	I have eaten here many times and have always had great service, food and value for money. Today was a slight let down. I found a sizable chunk of bone in my pie. When I was aked how was my food I reply apart from chewing down on the bone and hurting my tooth, He just laughed a said to my wife look at his face, I was not looking for a free me or a discount an apologie would have been fine but I did take kindly to being ridiculed.
-2	 This is a place for teenagers and young families who are not too picky on food quality. The staff were excellent but the food was processed frozen out of the box into the fryer rubbish. The music was uncomfortably loud, with continued happy birthday music which became tedious to say the least. The bar prices are expensive and the food costs are about average but still not worth what we paid for it. 
-2	 I've now eaten at The Magpie on three occasions since the new menu was introduced. It is very limited and my wife can find nothing that is not fattening to eat. She doesn't want to go there again. Gone are the pub classics and lighter meals. There are only seven main courses that are not vegetarian and only two of those. Chips or mash with everything. I have now run out of things I want to eat. Hard to pluck up the enthusiasm to go back. 
-2	1st night bed was made with just One sheet .. Complained .. Stopped there 3 nights appears I have bed bug bites and a athletes foot since staying here....paid £40 a night and car parking is not good !!
-2	 The Buck's Head Inn is an aspiring gastro pub situated on the busy A140 with plenty of parking. The seating area around the bar is pleasant and the restaurant is old style with dark wood tables and serviettes sticking out of wine glasses.  I never like to leave poor reviews, but this is the first time I feel let down by the star rating of a restaurant on Trip Advisor. It was averaging 4.5 or so, so I thought it was a safe bet. I had pork belly, my friend had a gourmet type burger with chips. The mash was luke warm (this was corrected without question). The pork was not very tender or flavoursome. And I was just plain disappointed with what was served to me.  It was a Friday night and even though we were there until 9pm there were only two other sets of customers. That in itself is no crime, but given the low footfall it is really not right to have to go find a front of house person on three separate occasions after waiting patiently, to take our order, to order coffees and to pay the bill.  So both of us felt the food was average, customer service was lacking, the atmosphere poor and we agreed that neither of us would visit again. It is possible I think someone else may go there and get a good meal but it won't be me. 
-2	 Now normally I do as you dear reader do.... check Tripadvisor before eating somewhere.... broke my own rule. Had a fair few half decent meals in Chinatown over the years..... this wasn't one of them!!   I thought 'what the hell'.... they're all OK...  Service was surly at best. But many are in that area.  We had mixed starters. Can't go wrong? Bit tasteless. Just about OK. Had a five spiced beef dish which was terible. Cold, lightly spiced plate of fat!   Crispy arom,atic duck was passable  Only one Rose (which was undrinkable.....luckily the Red was decent enough and 3 out of the 4 were on Red). They took back the wine but still charged for it!! The replacement Vodka & Lemonade was with Coke! My friend drank it as didn't want to wait any longer. The vodka is a VERY small shot...  The main wasn't too bad. Beef in black bean sauce was decent although Singapore noodles were cold & 'spiced' by just sprinkling curry powder over.  There's many a better place in Gerrard St....avoid this one 
-2	Having read the other reviews I was expecting a reasonable quality but it was easily one of the worst Chinese takeaways I have had. The sweet and sour prawns came in vibrant red sauce that surely was the product of artificial colouring. The lemon sauce for the chicken was a gelatinous lump that smelt and tasted of artificial flavourings. The taste was sickly and clinging. The prawns were rubbery, the chicken tough.  Maybe the restaurant food is cooked differently but the takeaway is very poor.
-2	 Whilst the pub and restaurant have been very tastefully decorated since it reopened, we were very disappointed with the service we encountered there.  We had booked a table for 6.15 and were shown to a table for two at the far end of the restaurant. The waiter took our drinks order immediately and these arrived a few minutes later. We were then given the menus and decided to only have a main course so there would be room for a sweet afterwards as we prefer that to a starter and main course. The waiter took our order for the main course at just before 6.30 pm. The main course (we both chose the same item from the specials board) did not arrive until 7.10 pm (a wait of 40 minutes). When it did arrive, although the hot pot that we ordered was very hot and tasty, the accompanying vegetables were under-cooked - the broccoli in fact was hard, and the potatoes on top of the hot pot wasn't crunchy,  After we had finished the main course which was not very substantial considering the price we paid and our plates had been cleared we were asked if we would like the sweet menu which we said we would. Fifteen minutes later I had to remind the waitress that this had not arrived to which she replied, &quot;I often forget to do that&quot;. Not very good in our opinion. As the sweet menu did not have anything we liked and also that we were worried that having had to wait so long for the main course that the sweet could take the same length of time, we went and paid our bill and left the restaurant at around 8.15, two hours after we arrived having eaten only a main course and had a drink.  One group of people who came in after us left because the vegetarian options had run out by 6.30 and another group were told they could not have mashed potatoes with their meal as they had also run out.   It is highly unlikely we will be making a return visit to this establishment. 
-2	I have given up going in here! Everytime I went in before 12.00pm, lack of hot pies/sausage rolls. Always got told&quot; Woant be long...In the Oven&quot; !
-2	 The whole experience wasn't altogether terrible, but the restaurant seems a little unloved with very little attention to detail.   We sat next to a broken window fixed with duck tape, the windows were shamefully dirty, the waiting staff weren't all appropriately dressed for a family restaurant and didn't even know if they provided wet towels or finger bowls for food like ribs. It also felt a little disorganised.   The toilets were also a disgrace. Cold taps were both out of order (without a sign) and I burnt my hands with scalding hot water that came out the hot tap. There was also a lot of muck around the sink and taps.   There was also a dull lifeless video projection of the grill that didn't add to the experience at all.   The food was ok, but overpriced. Around £20 for a whole chicken!   I think i was swept away by the initial excitement of copious amounts of bbq'ed meat, but the experience ended up being a little bla... 
-2	 Visited here this afternoon with friends. Lovely pub, can't say about the restaurant as we didn't eat. However we were rather disappointed with the drinks prices. £4.60 for a pint of San Miguel, £4.10 for a pint of Stowford press cider is rather pricey in my opinion. Needless to say we only stayed for 1 drink. 
-2	Many years ago this put was a great pub. Now it's up and down up and down and all over the place so you can never plan any more to go here or into Solihull for a bite to eat.  The problem is the larger pub chains and the lack of training for the young and inexperienced management.  For example if this pub was family owned it would be a completely different kettle of fish. As locals we need somewhere to go without problems.  Instead of so called manager saying &quot;sorry for your recent bad experiences that I have passed onto the management just sack them and give the job to someone who is proud to work for what was once a great place to eat with yearly beer festivals etc.
-2	 I have enjoyed many a good tea and cake at Bleasby tea shop but today's Jacket Potatoe with Stroganoff Sauce was truly repulsive.Not only did it look revolting but it's glutinous boiled onion tasteless sauce on a rubbery potatoe for £7.00 each was disgraceful.How difficult can it be to deliver something tasty that represents good value,what a disappointment. 
-2	 Very disappointed after hearing so many good reviews. Took an eternity to get our starters then another very long wait on mains. Was willing to forgive this if the food was worth the wait but it was average. Not bad by any means but just nothing special at all. I would not recommend it. 
-2	 Went here for lunch on a Saturday and was really disappointed with the whole experience. As a unique building, this business has an amazing opportunity to stand out for great service and eclectic dishes that really wow the customers - unfortunately, it did neither for me.  The decor is badly finished with cheap pub style tables and really poor condiment sets and cutlery. Add to this, the very young team of staff who were entirely uninterested in helping or serving and you have all the makings of yet another high street greasy spoon. I really don't like giving negative reviews, but in this case, I feel the owners really need to address some small points to make this venue really shine!  - There was no music, so no real atmosphere of any kind - Service was poor and unfriendly - Food was bog standard frozen stock, served with really cheap bread  I would be thrilled if just these three things changed as I really want this place to be great...but it's not right now! 
-2	 Sunday 18th - Morning  We headed to Cullercoats as Tynemouth Front Street was chocker with no where to park. I'd never been before to Beaches and Cream so decided to call in. Surprisingly on arrival there were empty seats both inside and out.  We chose a seat outside making the most of a lovely sunny Sunday morning.  After deciding what we would order I headed inside to the counter. I will return to table numbers later! There seemed to be a few staff behind the counter 'busy doing nothing'. I was eventually served and order taken. I ordered 2 scones, complete with jam and cream, red berry smoothie and a latte. I was asked my table number, to which I replied there wasn't one and pointed to the location of the table. I was given a post it note with a number on. On returning to the table I placed the post it note on the table (after moving the previous customers cups and plates) and waited for what we expected quite a short time for our order. We waited...... After approximately 20 to 30 minutes I asked a member of staff where our drink and food was. They asked what table number we were sat at and informed us it was on the way. The confusion around table numbers is quite clear. Every time a waiter/waitress appeared outside with food or drink they wandered around aimlessly looking at tables, asking people what they'd ordered. It looked embarrassing for all concerned.  Eventually my smoothie appeared on its own. Again I asked where the other drink and food was. It's on the way was the reply! We waited ..... Eventually the latte arrived, again after the waiter wandering around looking for its home.  Again no food! Remember it was only 2 scones!  We waited ..... I approached a member of staff again to ask where our scones were. It's on its way again was the reply.  Judith was half way through the latte before the scones arrived. Good job the weather was hot, otherwise the latte would have gone cold before the food arrived.  The scones were small, but they were fresh and tasty. The cream was in a plastic carton with the jam in a small dish. Certainly no complaints about the food. I would like to add the red berry smoothie was one of the tastiest I've ever had.  The service however is shocking. It wasn't busy, every table was dirty and full of plates and cups.  Can I suggest each table outside is numbered with a 1 to 15 (or however many there are) and the staff know which each one is. It looked a total shambles everytime food and drink was being served.  There also needs to be improvements in the time for simple food and drink to be delivered to tables.  Reading other reviews it seems the service is the main issue. Please get this right and I might return for another fantastic smoothie.   
-2	 I had higher hopes for this place. Maybe I've been to one too many indian restaurants now, but it didn't quite reach my expectations. It was poor service and ok food. 
-2	 The food was uninspiring but adequate, the staff were generally pleasant but we had issues with the manager. He refused to supply a wine by the glass that they had in open bottles as part of a &quot;free of charge&quot; offer, and when he did eventually do so, he did it very grudgingly and said he would not do it again in future. It made us think that it was not a problem because we would not be coming back again. I also very specifically asked him for a salad of plain lettuce rather than mixed leaves with my steak, and explained very carefully what lettuce actually is, but I still got mixed leaves! 
-2	 Visited on a quiet Monday lunchtime and ordered the burger, a ploughmans lunch and chicken salad. Food took quite a while to come and wasn't worth the wait. Burger was overcooked and nasty, the bun was too tough to eat. Chicken in the salad was overcooked, and the ploughmans was nothing special. It felt like the chef didn't know what he was doing.   Before we ordered the waitress warned us that there was &quot;only one chef on today, hence no specials&quot;??! When our plates were collected no comment was passed as to why most of the burger had been left uneaten.   The bill for 3 one course meals and one round of drinks came to nearly £40, astoundingly poor value. We wont be returning. 
-2	 Every time we meet up with our daughter,a visit to Thieving Harry's is a must for breakfast. Turned up Saturday morning already knowing what I wanted. The Breakfast bun at £4.95 egg, sausage,black pudding, tomatoes all served in the freshest bun possible. Looked at the breakfast menu and its gone. So opted for egg and bacon sandwich. Bread was sliced and hardish, overall was a bit disappointing really. 
-2	Visited here tonight for a Birthday treat for our grandson and we were frozen. We complained to the waitress who said there had been a problem with the air conditioning which had been turned off.  Air conditioning On 1st February what planet are they on. The radiator that was behind my wife and I did not work. People pay hard earned money for a night out and receive basic pub grub at top prices and are expected to eat it in the cold. The last time we ate here in December it appeared the waitress took her break between our courses and we were left waiting for over 40 minutes and had to complain. Avoid this place at all costs. There are far better eateries within a 10 mile radius.
-2	The staff are not waiters/waitresses just servers. No one smiles or greets you or interacts when ordering. They were totally disinterested in customers. It really is a place living off the attractions in Winchester rather than its own reputation.  The starters were not tasty although the main course lamb was fairly good. The night we went practically every main had french beans and spinach as a vegetable thus very little choice.  The only redeeming in feature was the draft Leffe beer.  I beleive this establishment aims to be an Hotel, a bar and a restaurant. Seems to be a Jack of all trades but master of none.
-2	 food excellent, but poor waiting times if sat with a large party 
-2	 Really disappointed. The food is cheap, but you get what you pay for! I counted 3 pieces of meat in my pie, the rest was just gravy. My wife had a curry and beat me, with 4 pieces! Won't be back. 
-2	 Galvin is generally known for service somehow all went rather poorly. The food was good but we were made to wait too long. Mediocre !!!!!! 
-2	 We went to the Grand Bazaar late on a Friday evening after going to a show that over-ran -- its main advantage over other nearby restaurants being that it was prepared to serve us at 11.30.  The place itself is a bit dark and cramped, but the food is actually quite good. We had Zeytinyagli Bakla (broad beans) and Hellim (grilled cheese), followed by their “Special Kebab” (in other words, mixed grill) and King Prawns. The portions were generous, and the service was efficient.  What riled me to the point of almost hitting someone was the old “double tip trap”. This used to be widespread, but it has almost disappeared in London because of widespread adverse publicity. Because Grand Bazaar is just off Oxford Street, they presumably attract lost of foreign tourists who are too gullible to fall for this old trick. But not me.  So as well as the 10% “service charge” on the bill, I was asked to add a “gratuity” when handed the payment machine. Given that most people would add a further 10% (or thereabouts), this is equivalent to charging 21% for service!  If everyone complains loudly when restaurants try it on, this practice (which is now rare) will disappear completely. 
-2	 Probably the rudest waiter and manager I've encountered. When the bill they gave us clearly wasn't ours they didn't apologise but acted as if somehow it was our fault and were extremely rude. I'd go to my local pizza express over this any day! 
-2	About 20 of us had our family Christmas meal here. The 3 course were cheap but that was understandable when they came out, everything looked and tested like it was cooked from frozen and the meat was just a plate of fat !!!!! One meal missing and bar staff would rather chat than serve customers. Place its self was nice tho just not ran well. Sorry
-2	 I don't like writing bad reviews but I'm mighty disappointed with meza on Mitcham rd  Been a few times before and found it great and loved the original in toot bec but these guys have really taken their eye off the ball . Service ok but rushed and disinterested . It's always busy but we had booked and just felt rushed throughout . Watery tomato sauce with burnt and old okra . Chick peas were awful , hard and terrible acidic tomato sauce . Kibbeh was grey mince and lacking fresh spicing . Mixed grill was lacking seasoning and came out very quick . In fact all food was very rushed . I noticed the original / chef owner is not there any  more . Makes a difference !! Hope things improve because it was great before . Will leave it and come back again one day 
-2	 New Seasons has been our favourite restaurant in Chorley for a few years for a combination of value, food and atmosphere. On the last couple we felt that they have beceome complacent. I even defended it to some people I had recommended it to who had some criticism of it. However our last visit was awful.   On the last few occasions they had run out of quite a few dishes. We put this down to the restaurant being small and our previous bookings being quite late. However on this last occasion we had an 830 booking and they had run out of 6 of the choices on the menu that we asked for. If it isn't bad enough the main frustration is being only informed when it comes to taking the order not when provided with the menu. The waitress didn't apologise for this but did say, &quot;why nobody thought about going shopping on a Saturday is beyond me&quot;.   Service was slow, which is not a major problem apart from the outside door was constantly left open leaving a freezing draft and the staff's failure to offer us any drinks after our first depite empty glasses.  The food itself was ok. A couple of our dishes were good although the smoked salmon starter had just been dumped on the plate. As it looked like it took 30 seconds to make I'm unclear as to why it took the best part of an hour to arrive.   The atmosphere has generally been quite jolly yet a person who we guessed at being the owner / manager was entertaining on the table next to us. Rather than directing staff on their jobs he was more intent on making them belly dance for his own amusement. Maybe this would have been fun if the service had been decent.   We decided to cut our meal short (no desert or coffees) and ask for the bill. The waitress advised us that the card machine wasn't working and they'd contacted everybody with a booking that day. We'd only booked that day and it hadn't been mentioned. Again, there was no apology although they did point us to the nearest cash machine.   It's a shame that I'm having to write this as it was really convenient for us but I think they have become complacement. Hopefully other customers will comment on positive experiences in the future and convince us to return. 
-2	 Having previously left a very positive review we have since had a number of take away collects from this restaraunt, usually good however very often they forget something and you have to drive back. Most recently a very bad experience, the usual drive back for forgotten items (i should check the bag at the bar i know) half full curry trays cold and swimming in grease, and a very dodgey stomach the next morning.   My last visit to a once lovely indian. 
-2	 This was a Sunday lunch with family on the suggestion of step son. The staff (1 girl behind bar and 1 lad serving on tables) were very helpful but look stretched as it was getting busy, we were seated and made our order, it was a mix from the menu. I had the Smothered Chicken, it was passable but the chicken was a bit dry, the onion rings soggy, chips reheated and so on. My wife had the Sunday roast and that was the same. It took a while for the meals to come, the poor lad on the floor was rush of his feet, it would help if they had more staff at busy times. It looked as though a lot of the food is prepreped and kept hot (good it you have a quick turn round) so dried out while waiting to be served. Will not be rushing to go again. 
-2	 The service wasn't good, they messed up the order, the meals were not hot, portions were small and the whole attitude was lax. Perhaps we went on a bad night, but for their prices I expected better. The children's play area was helpful during the long wait for the food to arrive. Because there is a captive clientele they seem to not be as sharp as they ought to be, I shan't be going again. 
-2	 My partner and I are big fans of all 'Ideal Collection' venues. Having been to The Bugle (hamble) and Boat Yard Cafe (swanwick) on numerous occasions.   Having amassed over £60 on our ideal collection loyalty card (which means we've spent over £600, we decided to give The White Star a try.   The food was very disappointing, the brioche bun was extremely dry and not up to the same standards as the other locations in the chain.   When ordering the bill we had been incorrectly charged but this wasn't a big issue.   My partners bread and butter was also dry and all in all I'm very glad we didn't have to part with actual cash.   Would have rather gone to The Bugle again.   A real shame. 
-2	 We live close to the China Garden, so it would be great if this was a good takeaway, sadly this is not the case.  We first tried the China Garden over a year ago, with a delivery. Unfortunately they got the order wrong, when I phoned they were not particularly helpful and I had to go and exchange the dish. Since then we have tried it a few more times, mainly out of convenience but we have finally learnt our lesson that the standard of food is average at best. Dishes are often bland with little veg in the ones that should have a decent amount. The prices are about what you would expect. 
-2	 I've been here a couple of times and everytime I order a Peroni, I get a pint with a 40% head. I ask them to top it up and i get &quot;that is how we serve our pints&quot; then I always have to show them exactly where on the glass the word &quot;1 Pint Line&quot; is marked. 
-2	Work nearby and decided to stop in for a takeaway lunch. Went for the large option with meatballs and was really disappointed with the portion size compared to the £6.50 I paid for it! The meatballs were really nice but the sauce and hummus were both quite runny. Doubt I'll be heading there again any time soon...
-2	 Having used this restaurant many times for coffee and lunch with family and friends the first evening meal was nothing short of a dismal failure. On previous visits during day the staff had been most helpful and friendly, and the cakes a delight.  However the evening meal on 11 April was another matter. Along with another couple who were visiting from France, we arrived and were shown to our table. The server introduced himself but the music was so loud we could barely hear what he was saying. To begin we each ordered the drink of the day (Bellini) but when they arrived they had been spilt as the bottom of the glasses were very wet and the result was drips onto both ladies’ skirts.   On asking for a wine list we were told that there were only a couple of wines available so we ordered what turned out to be a Pinot Grigio. When he brought the wine the server informed us that he had never before opened a bottle of wine with a cork then proceeded to wind the cork screw right through the cork and could not work out how to remedy the situation. I took over and opened the wine and then he started to pour the wine without asking if we wished to taste it.  One of us asked for a jug of water but it was only on the second time of asking that an individual glass of water was provided.  For starters we had chowder, crab cakes, and prawns and all were excellent, but no finger bowl was brought for the two who had prawns. When we asked we got one bowl and no extra napkins. When we had finished our starters only half the starter plates were cleared and we had to ask for the others to be collected before the main course.  For Mains two of us selected the Moules and two the Sea Bream. The Moules were excellent and the fish good (although a little dry on one side) but the vegetables served with the fish were luke warm. We felt that we could have been offered bread or potatoes with the fish.  For the Moules again no finger bowls were provided and we had to ask for them. The original bowl from the prawns (the ladies’ choice) was still on the table but only one bowl was initially provided for the Moules (the men’s choice). When we had finished the mains two plates were cleared leaving us to ask for the others to be taken (some of the long finished bellini glasses were still on the table too).  For dessert we ordered 1 peach concoction and 3 affogatos. When the peach dessert was served the recipient was told to be careful because it was hot.... the dessert itself was chilled so we are still not sure if that was a joke.  We could not believe our eyes when the affogatos were served. The dish comprised half a scoop of ice cream in a jam jar and an espresso coffee in a cup on a plate. Having poured the coffee onto the ice cream the contents were still barely visible (but £4 a throw). If you want to see how good an affogato can be head to Sopranos about half a mile away.  I know other people felt the music was loud and had said so but it would seem that volume control was too difficult.  Unfortunately for the restaurant (possibly fortunately for the potential customers) a party of 22 failed to show up for their meal. I dread to think what the service would have been like if they had. Now for the sting in the tail. On the morning of Monday 13th April my wife met the same friends for coffee at the Beach Cafe. My wife arrived first and ordered a Latte and a helping of chocolate and orange cake that was served by a polite female server. When our friends arrived a male server brought espressos for them and my wife paid him using a Debit card which for the £8 odd bill fell within the scanning limit (although no receipt was made available for her).  Shortly after leaving the restaurant our server from Saturday rushed down the promenade after my wife and our friends asking in a very loud voice if we had paid. The manner in which this was done was very tactless, embarrassing to all concerned and demeaning with strangers around.  We are local people and we like to give our support to local restaurants but at the moment the Southsea Beach Cafe is off the evening list completely. We are certainly not in the habit of walking out without paying.  The Cafe was informed of this sequence of events by private e-mail on 13th April but has not acknowledged receipt of that communication. 
-2	 What a hole. It's a massive building that chucks out cheap rubbish food and naff beer. Kind of like a Weatherspoons but much worse. OK you can have a massive plate full of food for about 28p and a pint of fosters for about the same price when the winds blowing in the right direction and the stars are correctly aligned, but there is a reason for this, It is the lowest form of food known to man. 
2	 I went there on a team building night out. It was fun and served its purpose. I wouldn't recommend this four couples or people who don't like loud music. 
2	 Superb little place. Have been here for Indian in the evening and breakfast in the morning. Great food, nice atmosphere and very good value. Is a BYO license so don't forget your booze !! 
2	 Lively curry house. Loud and not the always best service. Have been a few times and sometimes they will get the order a bit wrong, but are usually happy to fix it! Curry is always quality. Bring your own booze! Definitely worth a visit if you live in South West London 
2	 Spur of the Moment thing went for a Curry for tea. Been here a few times (actually my wife's favourite Indian). Staff very friendly and attentive, excellent choice on the menu and it won't break the bank. Food well presented and hot - oh and very good to. Try the banquet nights on Tuesday or Wednesday for a fixed price - great value. Recommended. 
2	Went to jamies on our last night here in Brighton the service was very good we had the steak which was cooked very well I had the meatballs which was good but wouldn't of said it was the best I've had pasta was average and just tasted bit bland if I'm truthful ordered side of chilli fries and garlic bread the chips where cold and classed as skinny bur tasted like ones you can get from Icelands the chips with the steak where very good and tasted fresh but the chilli fries dud not   Overall service very good but food not what I'd expect from a restaurant with jamies name on it
2	Great atmosphere, great menu choice, the waitress was excellent as too was the choice of cocktails and beers. A great place for couples and friends. My only criticism would be how quickly the food came. So quick it must be all cooked up and waiting to be ordered. However, it still tasted great!!
2	 Cheap place to hold a family gathering, food is very good and plenty of it, staff sometime struggle with English, but nothing a quick point from either side won't sort out, nice place. 
2	 Booked a table for dinner at the Hotel Tresanton on a recommendation and it didn't disappoint. We went on a day of mixed weather and were slightly unsure when we were showed to a table right at the front of the terrace. Of course, the views were fantastic - lovely touch to arrange the chairs so all 4 people could enjoy the view - but the ominous dark clouds made us slightly nervous. Luckily, it didn't rain so we enjoyed our outdoor meal in peace. It did get slightly cold and the heater by us seemed to be temperamental but can't fault our waiter who repeatedly attempted fix it. They provided blankets, anyway.   In terms of the food, it was delicious but having eaten in some unbelievable restaurants, I'd struggle to call it one of the best meals I've ever had. I'm not one for seafood therefore I'm probably not their best, or most fair, of judges but the roast chicken was good, just nothing to write home about. My family all enjoyed their meals, and the starters were particularly good. The staff were very attentive and were happy to make alterations to the menu to appease different palettes. The cocktails were also good but, like the food, were extremely expensive for what they were.  Would definitely return to the restaurant as the location, the atmosphere and the customer service are all excellent. The food is extremely good but in my opinion, it's not overly special. 
2	 been there on a few occasions for dinner on a Saturday and lunch on a Sunday .. dinner and lunch is excellent .. pub is in a great setting but a bit out of the way but worth the journey when it's nice weather so you can sit outside overlooking the green and village .. 
2	A great recommendation. Very understated restaurant and would be easy to pass on by.  Simple but exciting choice of menu including interesting breakfast options, light bites (not at all light) and main meals.   I had a crumbed pulled beef which had been cooked with rice, formed into a ball, dipped in a light batter and deep fried, served with a soft egg on top and fried plantain finished with a Brazilian hot sauce.  Washed down with a chilled Virgin Mary.  This was a light bite option but I could have fed my young family of five on this alone.  Interesting, tasty, huge and good value for money.  Some places just deliver and Carioca did with ease and excelled expectations.
2	 Excellent food would highly recommend it. Can not be beaten for quality value and price. Will be going again. 
2	 lovely old fashioned pub with several real ales and full of character. well worth a visit together with another pub close by called loggerheads, although didn't get there this time. 
2	great little café on a wonderful little beach, polite friendly staff, has a very good selection of tea etc.
2	 The Frozen Mop is on of those places you take the family or granny out for a meal in the countryside... It's nicely decorated with a lovely feel to the place.. it has a main restaurant and also little &quot;snugs&quot; to sit and eat if you wish.. I like the menu, it isn't pretentious and has all the classic meals with the occasional twist...if you are looking for reasonable value, quality food and good service in a lovely environment.. then i would recommend it  
2	Nice choice of food, well prepared and presented. Excellent vegetarian meal also. Mixed with the nice selection of wines, spirits and ales, we had a lovely first evening eating in the hotel.
2	 Had a drive out with the Mr & came across the marine hotel.. Decided on lunch from the bar menu. The lady behind the bar was very friendly & took our order. I chose Garlic Chicken Salad & he chose Scampi & Chips plus drinks.  They both tasted very nice & i would deffo eat there again. Prices were reasonable for a hotel the whole thing was £22.50... The guy next to me ordered fish and chips & the fish was MASSIVE.. i wouldnt have been able to eat it all but looked very nice though. 
2	A bit pricey, but a classy experience whether in the week with work or at the weekend with the family.  The tikka sea bass is a definite winner!
2	 My partner and I fancied a quick lunch in the Nailsworth area and had been reccomended Egypt Mill by a neighbour. The restaurant is spacious and very comfortable and while busy it was not too congested. The Lunch menu throughout 2014 is £7 for a main course Monday to Friday. It was great value and very well cooked. Service was excellent and very friendly. We will certainly pay another visit especially in the summer when the outside seeting area looks very inviting, 
2	 When you walk down the street towards this restaurant you can smell the burning charcoal and lovely aromas fill the air. If you like a Kebab on a Friday night when you are too drunk to appreciate any flavour then this is not for you. But if you like kebab the way it should be and love the authentic taste from this region then you are in for a treat. Love the Beyti Kebab, and they are always friendly and welcoming in the restaurant. 
2	 We've stopped off a number of times over the years and watched the many style changes the restaurant has gone through, however the one thing that hasn't changed is the food. Freshly cooked and hot Fish, chips and a decent portion of mushy peas. This visit was Friday evening 11/12/2015. So I was quite surprised at the negative comments on this site, just goes to show there are some miserable people out there. 
2	Good breakfast place ,convenient for Premier Inn over the road.Quick and friendly service with bottomless coffee.
2	 I'll be brief.  Location, Excellent  Staff, Very nice, attentive, pleasant and quick on a busy lunch time. Food, Good roast, nothing special but ok. Value, Good, Lunch for 4 and a few drinks, £104.00 not bad 
2	 Visited the coffee shop for some coffee, Dorset apple cake and stunning views. Wasn't dissapointed. Lovely day so went outside the front not the hotel where there was seating for the views and also a sculpture of the Olympic rings. 
2	 proper french food with great hosts and great atmosphere. sorry i didnt wirite this sooner!!! i will be back when next visiting the area. 
2	 We had dinner on Valentine's night. Things did not start well. Having given our name the Maitre D took us to the wrong table and then left us standing in the middle of the dining room like spare parts at a wedding while he went off to find the right table. Having seated us he brought the wrong menu so then went off again to find the correct one. We were surprised at the lack of professionalism.  After that however things greatly improved. The sommelier and the waiters were excellent. The menu was varied and beautifully presented. It tasted good too. We would have given 5 stars had it not been a poor start. When we are next in London we may pay another visit. 
2	 The Old Brewery came recommended by a friend and it didn't disappoint, the beers are excellent and the food was really good too, my wife had the rabbit terrine as starter and she really enjoyed it, while the whitebait I had was crispy and nicely season. Our main courses too were well presented, especially the sea trout my wife had my pork belly wasn't bad either. 
2	 Great atmosphere and a good selection on the menu, unfortunately the scallops had for a starter were gritty as they must not of been washed well. Also the chicken kiev my mother has was dry and came with an enormous amount of potatoes. I had the t-bone steak for main and although it was nice for the price I expected a bit more. 
2	 Walking in, it certainly has its own character, which you wouldn't expect from how it looks on the outside. The menu is dripping in BBQ glory, I opted for the pork burger and was not disappointed. Though pricey, it tasted great, it would've been nice to have some fries thrown in for the cost though. Enjoyed the rum-based cocktail (forgetting the name) but complemented the food nicely. A few of us stayed later for the live music, all very enjoyable and a nice evening out overall. 
2	 Good food, well prepared and a nice selection. Family oriented except for the price. You will enjoy. 
2	If you have the money, this would make a nice regular pub. Quirky setting and nice atmosphere, but a little on the expensive side. You get views of the platforms of KX, which is quite nice too.   Tip: ask about the 'Fullers Vintage' beers. They usually have a number of different years to choose from, all of them good, all of them different! And they're served in a funny little box. Which is funny.
2	 Don't let the &quot;Fish and Chips&quot; put you off - this is a high quality restaurant with good food, good serving sizes (I never go for the large portions now!) great service, always clean and it's licenced if you need a drink. I always order lightly battered fish, my wife always have grilled fish with salad. I have never been disappointed here and will always visit when in Shepton. 
2	 Enjoyable visit, generous portions, good atmosphere. Popped in for a late lunch on a sat afternoon, staff where very welcoming and friendly, menu was a excellent , food fresh and delicious, maybe a bit to rich for my taste. Pleasent surprise, they gave us our starter as a complimentry when our bill arrived. thanks to all concerned, will definately use again 
2	 This restaraunt provides a varied selection of cuisine from the mainly Indian menu. The service is good with knowledgable staff who are happy to explain the menu and suggest appropriate side dishes. The food was full of subtle flavours with nothing overpowering or over spiced, despite having a byriani it was not a mouth burning experience but perfectly balanced. Definitely one to return to :-) 
2	I would highly recommend the Bloody Mary burger, well actually any of the burgers.  Generous portions and friendly staff. I enjoy the humorous quirky menu however i wouldn't recommend this place if your looking for a romantic meal as it's not that pretty and has the odd old dog wandering about.
2	The food is excellent and rates highly with the family. Family age ranges are from 3 yrs to 63 yrs. Really friendly reception, followed up with very friendly and helpful staff. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere, which is great for enjoying a relaxing family meal.  The meal was delivered fresh and hot and within a very acceptable time scale from ordering. As a family we have visited the restaurant on 3 occasions and will certainly add to that figure. An all round very good experience. I would certainly recommend the Las Iguanas restaurant at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol and just a few minutes drive from the Cribbs Causeway, M5 Motorway junction.
2	 this place is very good value for money, even excluding the fact that you can get 50% on a tastecard. if they just tidied up a few minor details on the service side it would be a 5. the bread was very very good, the starters were a bit hit and miss, both main courses were delicious. additionally they need more toilets. 
2	 Popped in here for a quick bite to eat. Service was pretty prompt, given there was a large queue for takeaway (always a good sign!). We had 2 x haddock and chips and 2 x pie and chips, with a drink each, which still gave us change from £30 for a couple of ice creams. 
2	So went there for lunch after showing the old man around town, had always been curious about the place as I had lived quite close to it previously. Turned out to be a surprisingly enjoyable meal.   Both had the burgers on with cheese, which on the lunch menu is £6, along with our pick of the local beers on offer. Biggest surprise was the burger, juicy and flavorsome, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Even with the monetary jack cheese being the choice of cheese, it is still better than a lot of place I've been to that boast about their burger. Along with some decent chips on the side..£6 or £5 without cheese, an absolute bargain.   Service was perfectly fine and the meals came to us in pretty good time, which considering they had a party of I guess 15plus downstairs and fairly busy with the room up stairs is pretty good.   The only thing slightly negative is that we were there on a hot day and it was very hot in there, not sure if they do have air con. However with it being Liverpool the chances of that being a factor in your trip to it are, sadly, quite small.  Thoroughly recommended though due to the size I'd say book ahead if you're going at peak times.
2	Nice pub with a fair selection of well kept real ales. We did not stay but the rooms looked fabulous. The location is the real story here - in the centre of Bewdley town overlooking the river: quite wonderful!!
2	 My husband loves seafood whereas I'm vegetarian so trying to find a restaurant that we both enjoy can prove tricky but I'm pleased to say having eaten in this restaurant last year we thought we would be ok and we definitely were. We sat outside on a Saturday evening with our 2 dogs and had a very enjoyable meal. He had chilli crab linguine and I had pea, mint and pine nut risotto- both were excellent. Definitely worth another return visit next year..... 
2	Pleasant enough pub, good beer choice, food is standard menu, but better cooked than in many Spoons. Staff are really good, which makes it above average. Nothing to complain about, cheap and cheerful
2	Been here twice now. Both times the food was great and the service was impeccable. It is a step up from the average Indian. Very good value as well. Looking forward to our next visit
2	 I have visited this restaurant many times in my life and never consider looking at another restaurant in Chinatown. The vast menu has something that every customer would be happy with, all at good prices. As other people have mentioned the staff are not the most caring, but for most people this simply adds to the appeal of this restaurant. Whenever you visit, the restaurant is always busy, but the five floors mean that you will never have to wait for a table 
2	 Made by Jonty came recommended by friends so we decided to try it for brunch. There was already a queue when we arrived and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. There is no shortage of local alternatives but we decided to wait and see what the fuss was about. It was only about 15 mins and then we were offered a shared table, which as we were only a couple we accepted.  I was a bit alarmed to see Linda Macartney sausages on the veg menu, but went for the full cooked breakfast. The food was okay but the plate was red hot which did not help the beans or tomatoes.  The was a lively atmosphere and the staff bright and cherry and there is a lot going on around there. If you want a local produce breakfast then cafe aroma about 300 yards away is a better bet, but lacks the same atmosphere. 
2	 Had a wonder round Keswick, chose this place to eat from the many that are available. Absolutely great tasting food, at a decent price too. The only down side is the amount of tables available inside the pub. We were lucky though as the weather was nice and there's plenty places to sit outside. 
2	very nice fresh fish and chips,good service from pleasant counter staff,only negative was the loud MTV playing
2	 The decor is a little dated but I cannot fault the food or service. The staff were very attentive and always ready to answer questions. The food was well presented and tasted wonderful. I would not hesitate to recommend this place. 
2	 Been here lots of times with friends and also as a couple and never been disappointed. Food and service is excellent. Value for money is fantastic. I find it unbeatable. If you're looking for a good Indian in the High wycombe area, I would not hesitate to recommend it. 
2	Went here last night after a day out at the football. Booked in advance after seeing some good review on tripadvisor.  Menu has plenty of options , first time I've seen a mixed bhuna at a curry house.  All 4 of us enjoyed our staters and mains would definitely go back again next time I'm back in Hull.
2	 Nice meal in recently refurbished inn. Our waitress, Stephanie, was helpful and we received quick and efficient service. Good choice on menu. Will return soon. 
2	 All you can eat Brazilian with excellent service !! Their food is above average. And the selection is immaculate !! Drinks are lovely and you can eat us Much as you wish paying around 30gbp ! Excellent location and service as well !! Definitely give it a go !! 
2	 that baby drake guy is so sound! gave us excellent service, would definately come back again, was a pleasure 
2	Excellent welcome on arrival. All staff very courteous and attentive throughout visit. Food choice is good and all dishes were presented nicely. Everything cooked beautifully and tasted great. Overall ambiance is very good but would suggest that the music choice is reviewed - I'm not knocking Chas and Dave, but for me, an Indian meal is better accompanied by relaxing Indian music. Lastly, if you use reading glasses - take them with you as the detailed writing on the menu is quite hard to make out. Notwithstanding the music and menu, a great evening out - Thanks SC.
2	 We've been going to The Fox for years, but Kate and Buddy - the new owners - have given it a new lease of life .. re-decorated and smart, with a clever and tasty Caribbean themed menu, plus traditional pub food, it's a really warm, friendly and pleasant pub to visit. There's a function hall out the back, plenty of seating in 4 areas around the bar and extensive garden space, plus a kids' playground. All in all, a great friends and family pub, with plenty of parking too ... 
2	 Although we are local, this was our second visit, the first being last year. The service was excellent and friendly. The management that run this and certain other local restaurants are very good at selecting staff. Two of us had the lemon sole, which was beautifully prepared, and the third the steak which she said was excellent. Two of us has sweets, both of which were outstanding. The cooking here is of a standard to win awards, I am sure.  There are a couple of gripes: The restaurant itself is very light and airy, but there is nothing to absorb the sound of chatter which echoes around the room making conversation difficult, especially if anyone in your party is hard of hearing. The other is outside the control of The Square, but it is the usual one: Parking.   The town car park is nearby, but the aisles are narrow and the ticket machine when we went didn't work properly. Many people had problems understanding it, not helped by the instructions which said &quot;press the green button for the ticket&quot;. Fair enough, but there wasn't a green button! I think the sunlight had made it fade to blue. Also, it was nearly full in April - one can only imagine what it would be like in season.  Porthleven itself is a nice place to walk around a small Cornish seaside town with harbours and gift shops. Given that you have found a parking space, it is well worth buying an extra hour or so and taking advantage of this on a nice day. Have a look on Google Earth street view and check for the video on You Tube. 
2	Decided as a family to have a pizza night. Original plan was Dominoes, but decided to give here a go as they're just around the corner.  3 very nice 9.5in thin crust pizzas and garlic bread pizza for under £20, and to be honest they where worth every penny!  We certainly won't be going anywhere else in future for pizzas
2	 We walked in at 6.30 on a Saturday night and were able to get a table for 10 with no difficulty. Its a buffet style place but was excellently well stocked throughout and tasty to boot.  My only gripe was in regards to a 2nd round of drinks we ordered. It took 15 minutes to get 10 bottles of beer, by this time we were finishing our dinner and decided to cancel the order. The waiter said we couldnt do this as it was in his computer and he couldnt deselect. When he started saying something into his radio we noticed the drink being quickly placed on the bar and opened. Thought the staff were a bit dismissive of us.  In general lovely food, plenty of tables and once of the nicest buffet places I have been in, just too slow to deliver drinks. 
2	 The THALI is a great way to sample several different starters/sides and a small curry of your choice. Loads to eat, without being over-faced, and all wonderfully flavour-some. 
2	 The staff were welcoming and friendly the food was what you would expect,overall a reasonable experience. 
2	Had a great Tapas lunch at Marco's with family.   Food & service were very good! A great variety on the menu.   We had the lunch option & chose around 6 dishes between two of us.   Will defintly be coming back Highly recommended!  
2	 I think I got taken to this pub when I was much younger and living about 20 miles away. Since then I've grown up a lot and moved to Huddersfield and now live about 10 minutes away. Always a good meal here, I've never been and left either dissapointed with the food or service, or felt like I was still hungry. Thoroughly good value for money and would always come here for a carvery over the Toby down the road. 
2	 The restaurant is a short walk from Camden tube station.  Seated quickly (we did book ahead), so no waiting. The restaurant was busy but in a lively manner with people enjoying each other's company and the food too.   We chose to have one of the set menu options (although there is a full extensive menu available) as this would provide for a good selection of Greek cuisine the restaurant does. We were not disappointed!  A starter of salad, bread and the usual tzanziki & hummus dips. In addition three hot starters served too - Greek sausages, calamari & halloumi. This was followed by Chef's mixed grill. We thought were finished but after feeling rather full were presented with a lamb shank. This was simply mouthwatering - the meat fell from the bone with no effort at all. And bags of flavour to boot!   My partner having returned from a recent trip to Greece found the food better than that in Athens!   We even went for the Greek wine too and wasn't disappointed.   All of the staff are very friendly and you can see you enjoy having a full restaurant with happy people enjoying their food. 
2	 Went for an evening meal decent food nice presentation good value for money ,service and decor was excellent 
2	While at the opening day of the Wirksworth Festival we booked a very rare table forgetting that the last train back to Derby was just over an hour away.  Being in a hurry we only had a main and we had to rush it. But they were both gorgeous. I had the leek and wild mushroom risotto which was very tasty and my partner had the beef bourguignon which was also delicious and when he asked for rice rather than mash; that was no problem.  The service was brisk and very professional and the atmosphere was amusingly Gallic, right down to the kitchen staff having their sleeves and trousers rolled, not folded, up. Actually rolled. Like donuts.
2	I last visited this restaurant a year ago and thought the place expensive, I have revisited and found a contrast to a year ago. The menu is clearly redesigned showing more options and prices available, though the wine is listed on the boards in chalk above your head and if you do not look you will miss the prices. The meals from cheap to expensive depending on what you want to consume, look at the menu for a cheaper variant if available. Wines range with a decent taste to the palate, both a good range of white, red or rose wine available. Food is freshly cooked so expect about 20 minutes, so if alone - take a book or a kindle ( I did and no objections raised)  If there is a group going I recommend making reservations beforehand. Without a drink, a meal can cost less than £10
2	 This was recommended by our B&B host and we were not disappointed, there was a good menu choice and portions were generous, to the extent that we had to forgo the sweet course. The food was well cooked and presented. We enjoyed reading about food in the 1950's on the reverse of the menu, recognising the tremendous changes in food since then. 
2	 We visited Worthing to see how it changed since I was there last which was 1988. It's still the same as it's very quiet. The pier is as good as it was then. Great atmosphere. 
2	 We eat here several times each year and have always found the staff most helpful and very courteous. The tapas are very good value and most suit are palates, the salt cod being absolutely exquisite, the pig's cheek is also excellent. The house wine is recommended, especially the dry white. We will keep coming back. 
2	 Came here fort food as we were staying and working in the area. Restaurant is very nice inside and roomy. The service we had was great from an attentive waiter. The food was excellent and well priced. The free brandys at the end of the meal was also a nice touch. 
2	 We were on a cruise break and so were in Southampton for the evening.  We therefore wanted somewhere near the quay to eat.  This is a cosy, relatively small restaurant with some nice touches. Home made delicacies add to the quality. We had some nice cheese pastries.  The fish tasted fresh and was well cooked and our desserts were lovely.   Portions are small but you get quality not quantity and that was okay for us.  Cocktails were a little overpriced and some of the supplements hard to justify but overall we enjoyed our visit and would go back. 
2	Went there with family. The food was very good, i recommend the roasted duck, the crispy duck. Waiters were attentive and kind. I strongly recommend. Price are adapted to the quality of the food.
2	 The food here was very good and the portions good value for money. enjoyed the battered cod and chips 
2	this was our first visit to the Jolie Brise which opened in the (so called) summer. Its handy to the train station and about 5 minutes from the sea front. There are bars on 2 floors and they have a good selection of drinks. The prices seemed a little inflated for a Spoons but not too bad. Usual Spoons food menu. We sat outside on the first floor patio which is excellent. Bar service was average and food took 40 minutes but it was busy. When I bought second round the girl serving drinks was very inexperienced especially at pouring the lively lager! There was probably more on the floor than in my glass! Staff are pleasant though. Toilets are miles away as usual up lots of stairs but very clean and tidy. I imagine next summer when the grockles discover this pub it will be manic! Would we go there again? Yes.
2	The fish and chips are really very good indeed lovley crisp batter and hand cut chips tasty and the big ones are a little soggy and the thin ones crisp. The cost is about 7.50 to eat in which is fair, although extras can be surprisingly expensive and hte beer is well dear. The food was made less enjoyable because they insist on wiping the tables around you with a really unpleasant smelling bleach Overall an excellent pre theatre option   The seats outside are great and really good atmospere overlooking the boats and theatre
2	 The food here is sumptuous and the groceries for sale abound. A very welcome stopping place at the edge of a very busy road. Not to mention being able to visit the farm animals. 
2	 Always been very good when we go here! we go back so that says it all.. service is always good too, and the food is always quick! love it 
2	 As some friends and I are meting up for an evening out next month, I said I would investigate Jamie's as a potential venue. I was shown to a table in the window area, great view of St Martins but also the less impressive construction work! The friendly waitress arrived within 2 minutes of my sitting down and asked if I wanted to hear about the daily specials. I'd already decided what I wanted from the main menu but later heard her give the details to other diners and was impressed with her detailed knowledge of each of the dishes she was describing. My food was absolutely fine; a starter of mushroom bruschetta, main course of roast scallops and posh chips, and finish with an extremely rich chocolate and espresso tart. These were all well cooked (the chips are absolutely perfect!). My only slight reservation was the layer of rock salt that the scallop shells sit in to prevent them sliding over the plate. A good idea unless you also have the fennel and lemon salad on the same plate! Inevitable result is that the salad leaves were rather over-salted. I think that one needs a re-think. Drinks of a glass of prosecco and a decent sauvignon blanc, plus a very decent macciato gave me a bill of £41. Not cheap but certainly reasonable value for the quality of ingredients and the skill in the cooking and (mostly) presentation! I was dining quite early so the place was not even close to full but there was a friendly buzz of conversations from the other diners. Decor was ok, reminded me of The Gourmet Burger Company in Brindley Place. I've given my thoughts to my friends and we are definately going there in April. Its not the best restaurant in Brum but then its not pretending to be. What it is is good food, drink and atmosphere tied together in a not-too-expensive bundle. Well worth a visit. 
2	 Booked Real Greek in St Martins Lane for a pre theatre meal. Service was all one could wish for:fast, pleasant, helpful, smiling. Food was good, tasty, what it said on the tin. And yes the chips ARE light fluffy and delicious as the menu promises. Salt cod great. Chicken skewers a general favourite. Thin site and quite small so imagine could get crowded. Jolly and friendly, heart if West End, rather than place for a romantic date or business meet. 
2	 weatherspoons spotted on a find your way walk by accident. about 8pm maybe a bit later and we were struggling for ideas so went in. it was busy but we found a table. soon as my bum hit the seat a member of staff cleared it and wiped it down for us.   i enjoyed my john smiths, and we ordered food. food was constantly flowing out of the kitchen, and it wasn't too long before ours came out. the food was hot cooked properly. we had another drink and left around 10pm.   we went back Wednesday but later on. we ordered different meals and again we were not disappointed. my only niggle on this visit is the barman seemed to be a bit slow, and unaware of who is next in the cue. however one of the others was worse for wear so best he jumped in i suppose. 
2	 This is my first time at a MPW restaurant and I bought the groupon deal as we were staying local in a different hotel and found it by chance. The restaurant is lovely, the service was good, food was plentiful, good quality and piping hot. I eat a lot of steaks and this was up there with the best. The only downside was my wife's was a lot smaller with quite a bit of fat on it but apart from that we had an excellent meal. 
2	 Think this was the third time we have been here on one of my trips back to the homeland to catch up with good friends. Food and service as good as ever, especially as our waitress made a special effort to secure the last two skate wings for us.  Good menu and wine choices, all very reasonably priced. Very busy so definitely best to book, a good sign to justify rating. 
2	Just had a couple of drinks at the bar. Adverts for Players No 6 cigarettes and Cherry B , a Double Diamond pump on the bar and a landlord, rather than a manager. I had a pint of mild. I thought I was back in 1974 when I first starting frequenting pubs. Unfortunately it wasn’t 16p a pint!!
2	 Had a beautiful meal last night as a group of us celebrated my friend's 60th birthday. All the meals were excellent and the service was very good with attention to detail.  Obviously this is run by a new owner who is &quot;finding his feet&quot;, but I could not fault his work so far.  I particularly liked the chicken in the sauce with English mustard. Excellent.  I would not criticise anything at all. Very good and I would recommend it 
2	 Fleet does not have too many places where you can go out for a relaxed pub-style drink and a good meal with friends and/or family. The wheatsheaf does all of that in spades ! Food is as good as it gets in these types of larger gastro-pubs and generally the clientele is not too roudy so it's a civilised environment to take friends and family out for lunch or evening drink and meal 
2	Excellent food  Good quality .   Lighting maybe a little too bright - but you can see what you are eating . really nice Good size portions   WINE OK,  service good
2	If you want to call out for decent Chinese food, you can only get better by paying a lot more.  We've been using the Wei Fung for years and never starve!
2	Very surprised by the decor inside the resturant as the outside does not look to inviting.The food we was served was tasty ,hot, and very well cooked ,staff were very good and was very good value for money, we will be going again. Here's hoping they keep up the quality of food and don't fall by the wayside like most indian resturants seem to.
2	 I first saw this resturant from the other side of the road, having a drink this resembled a usual ice cream, tea room. Staying in Minehead we explored the evening resturant scene. Upmarket resturants with price`s to match abound in harbour vicinity. My wife suggested &quot;Mullions&quot; not by reputation but simply on a whim, the meal was something to be remembered so much so we are staying for a few days and hopefully repeat our experience foe a second time. 
2	 A good find. Hmmm... get take away or eat inside the restaurant for 4x the price? I think I'll get the take away, thank you very much. The pieces of fish were HUGE, so I can't even image what the jumbo sized portions are like. I was greedy and ordered the large portion of chips, which were great and still tasty cold a couple of hours later. I liked the care in which the guy salted the chips and tossed them slightly before wrapping it up for take away.   All in all, friendly staff and great fish and chips. After all, it's the healthiest meal for all the family, according to the print copy on the package! 
2	We were guests at a wedding recently and thoroughly enjoyed this alternative and quirky venue. Although not the biggest, it felt homely, with plenty of nooks and crannies to it. The staff were so helpful and always willing to offer assistance. The food was ample and very decent indeed, with the drinks surprisingly well priced considering it was a wedding (most venues see this as a chance to ramp up the price!). Brilliant, really enjoyed it. Well done to all the staff.
2	 Lovely old building, well stocked bar, good friendly staff. Food was good, service good. PLUS they have some good music nights especially when the Waveney Valley Folk Collective have one of their special evenings - worth looking out for.... 
2	 I was always going to like Sketch.  I’d heard tell of its weird arty ethos long before I ever set foot in it.  It’s got an impressive list of credentials and its location on one of my favourite streets in the city, near Vivienne Westwood, and the East Indian Tea Company among other things, tipped the balance (unfairly perhaps) in it’s favour. But it’s always a nice surprise when things live up to expectations. However biased, arbitrary and unrealistic they might be.  The restaurant (or parlour) is an oddball mix of Art Deco, Victoriana and quintessential teatime kitsch. Perhaps not to everyone’s tastes, but it’s undeniably quite unique and at a push rather brilliantly bizarre.  A slightly digitised vintage soundtrack hums away in the background while you choose from the old school print inspired menu, featuring lists of bizarre mix match ingredients and converted classics that catch your eye.  Tea arrives and is poured at a pleasantly eccentric angle for you. My order of the croque monsieur (on squid ink bread) was served on a rustic wooden platter that seemed to me to be straight from an episode of David Lynch’s Twin Peaks.  If there are such things as acquired tastes, then perhaps Sketch is one. But for me at least it’s a taste I very much look forward to acquiring a little more of, amongst good company and tea cups on conduit street. 
2	 Very good value fixed price lunch menu with lots of choice. The food itself is carefully prepared and well presented in clean, relaxing surroundings. I confess I've not been to India, but I wouldn't be surprised if the flavours here are up with the best there. Well-defined, fresh tastes and complex spices hit the spot - and all just up the road from where the Beatles came from. I hope Sir Paul drops by this place one day. He'd like it. 
2	 This is not the place for hi class food but what you do get is really good pizza and pasta at prices nobody could complain about. I had the fixed price menu and had mushrooms as a starter then an American hot pizza. Really nice pizza with a thin and crispy base, no soggy bottom here. The staff were really nice and the overall service prompt. They have some nice tables outside where you can watch the world go by. I am amazed that we have lived here three years and only just discovered this little gem on the heart of the city. 
2	We shared a Seafood selection and were not disappointed. Lovely cod, prawns, calamari, fishcakes and chips & dips. Great value and nice staff.
2	 This restaurant is a gem yet to be discovered by the trip advisor community. It seems like the personnel is a bit unexperienced, but making a good effort. The dishes I ordered were quite good. They also have a very nice selection of asian beers. 
2	 Go in there frequently, at least once a week. Sometimes I will have a bite to eat as well which you can have hot or cold. Now that they &quot;Barista of the year&quot; working there it makes it that bit better! 
2	Just give it a try.best venue in town.i will let u be the judge.great Food great vibe. i am a regular .poss a pain in the butt .but so what i like it there .ok mel .not been disapointed yet ..so keep it going guys and gals
2	 The range and quality of the food is unsurpassed anywhere for miles around. Beautiful Jewel of a restaurant that is somewhat hidden by its first floor location.  Not at all overpriced, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants food quality, decent value food with a touch of class 
2	 We eat here whenever we are in the area. Friendly and helpful staff and good range of choices. Attention is paid to all the food, so that even the side salads are well thought out and presented. Well patronized, so you may need to book. Prices are reasonable as the quality is very good. 
2	 efficient friendly service, good menu choice, had a three course meal which I couldnt fault.Q Tahir was my waiter, he said to let him know anything I wanted, and he was quick to spot me beconing him for service, with a smile and friendly comments/ advice. Excellent. 
2	 Had a really lovely meal here on a Wednesday evening in March 2014. Cosy restaurant, top pub nosh and a great selection of real ales. Good wine too. A bonus was live music - an excellent acoustic trio who really added to the enjoyment and ambience. The service was really good too. Friendly, relaxed and efficient. Nothing was too much trouble. 
2	 We have been to the Fox And Goose before and have always had good food. Today was no exception. The service was excellent as was the beer, a good choice of beers including one from Thornbridge that was an American Pale Ale. Will go again for the pies. 
2	 I do not bother to write poor reviews except when I feel ripped off, This is certainly not the case here! Tapas night on Thursday and Sunday, is a brilliant concept; looks best to book to avoid disappointment. Stuffed with good food and such a selection between the two of us. Good value and as tasty as any bag of seaside chips. House white is excellent, staff are attentive and put up with old gits very well. A place to visit even if dining solo: as it is small and friendly. I will return on a friday (staff night) to see what the chef can do with his once a week specials. 
2	 A very popular restaurant that serves great food and has friendly staff but i ordered a hake dish and got Cod, i was a hake fisherman for 20 years so i know the difference this was disappointing as everything else was lovely. 
2	 Four of us ate here on Saturday night. The pub and restaurant were busy but still the service was outstanding, food excellent, price was very good value for money and most of all the atmosphere was really upbeat. I would recommend to all ages. 
2	Staying in Derby myself and two of my colleagues decided to visit the Shalimar as one of them had dined there a couple of years ago and said it was good then! Really glad we did as the food was great, we decided to go for the banquet and it wasn't a dissapointment. Sadly we did get over faced and struggled to eat it all but maybe that's not such a bad thing. If i'm ever stopping in Derby again i would certainly revisit. 
2	 Newly refurbished Chapel in Dunster has been renovated into a light and attractive tea room offering a selection of teas, coffee light lunches and cakes as well as selling affordably and reasonably priced art and craft items.  The owners make it a friendly and welcoming environment and it offers something different from the other more traditional cafes in the village and i particularly enjoyed many an hour spent eating a brownie alongside with a cup of coffee while taking a sabbatical from work in Dunster. I was particularly impressed with their willingness to improve their fayre and accomodate my partner by making gluten and dairy free cakes and bread. Has wifi too.  I wish Gareth and Jonny well in their new venture 
2	This is a very well known, yet very quiet pub like restaurant in South Shields. As a group of about eight we decided to pre-order our food in which the staff were very grateful for with the group ordering a wide range of food from Toasties to Fish and Chips. The service was very good, very quickly although not the friendliest. My Toastie was lovely and everyone was very satisfied but the atmosphere was extremely lacking and the establishment felt overly cluttered with old antiques.
2	 Myself and 4 friends visited 'The Flying Fox' on Saturday for a social catch up. It's clear to see the pub has recently had a face lift as things looked very different from the last time we came, in a positive fashion! However, the menu was still the same and I'm getting rather bored of the same pies and beers on the menu.   Our waitress was lovely and very attentive but our favourite waiter seems to have left the pub, which we are gutted about! Flying fox, hold on to the good ones!  My friends and I look forward to heading back soon for hopefully another lovely time! 
2	 Nice country pub with helpful staff in the heart of Witlshire. Children and dogs welcomed. We ordered food as soon as the restaurant opened but despite this the food was great. 
2	 Not too expensive and nice friendly atmosphere , only critique would be out food seemed to come out at different times and we were left waiting for our rice to arrive for some time , food was lovely thoe!  We were even given a complementary shot of sambuka after our meal!  Will visit again 
2	 After having recently got back from the Caribbean I was missing the food so chose here during a visit to Bristol. I'd pre-booked a table as I'd heard it was almost essential due to the place being so popular. It was certainly packed when we went there! This was done by filling in a simple form on their website, and they call back to confirm. The service was quick, friendly and accurate and the food spot on. If you want to dine early you also have the advantage of 2 for 1 cocktails between 6pm and 7pm :)All in a very enjoyable visit, though the bill was more eye-watering than the sauce... Keep an eye on your tally and you'll have a good night. 
2	 Me and my family came here for my brothers birthday and had a very enjoyable experience.  For an 'all you can eat', the food was very good quality, very nice and the staff were also very friendly and nice.  Couldn't ask for much more really. 
2	 Well worth seeking out. Authentic, fresh and tasty italian food. Reasonably priced in a nice atmosphere. All pizzas, pasta and meat dishes we have tried are top notch. Gets regular return visits from many of the locals (like us) which is always a good sign.  If you are in the area and in the mood for italian food then sizzlers is a great choice. 
2	Baltic serves an eclectic mix of dishes from Eastern Europe with hints from the Ashkenazy tradition. Warming stews and soups and filling desserts make this a great place to visit. My experience is of lunch time when the restaurant is not busy but friends tell me it gets very busy in the evening so booking is essential. The service is very good and the restaurant serves an extensive range of cocktails and wines
2	 Quick service wide selection of HOT & COLD dishes. At reasonable prices. Children eat free school nights. 
2	 Called in about 3pm Sunday and was delighted that they were still serving lunch. Excellent beef for 3 lunches but a little disappointed with the pastry on the pie. Spoke to chef who said the pie in the week was a full bake rather that just the top crust - I suggest you do that for Sunday or just not offer it. All round good food and drink and at a reasonable price. Well done! 
2	 I've been eating at The Yeung Sing for decades, and have never been disappointed. The staff are friendly and professional, the food is excellent, and we always have a good experience. I particularly like the living social deals, which offer incredible value for money! 
2	 Great American menu, everyone on our table left satisfied. My only regret is ordering the mushrooms in batter to start. Very sickly and struggled to finish. My pulled pork wrap for my main was epic though. 
2	We arrived at about 8.30 on a Thursday night and were seated immediately. Our waitress took our drinks order as soon as I'd chosen the wine and delivered them with a selection of breads.  Our orders came quickly and I had an excellent pizza. 5 weary men were well fed and watered; we'll go back again next time we're in town.  Good cheerful service throughout the evening.  A quick check and we found we could download a money off voucher as well - bonus.
2	 A Wetherspoons pub, with good selection of cask beers, plus the usual.There is a nice beer garden out back. 
2	 i can really recomend the cottage having visited many times over several years , the place is very under used which could put you off till you get to the food , great value , good portion sizes and really friendly staff 
2	 A varied menu - plenty of choice, pleasant atmosphere & Vanessa our waitress was very friendly & helpful. Food was rather slow to arrive but was very tasty. Overall very good. 
2	 Food: Delicious and reasonably priced - main's ranged from about £10-16. I had the Pork Belly (approx. £14/15) which came with a nice big slice of pork with crispy crackling, and apple sauce on the side and roasted vegetables with morrocan spices. My partner had the Lamb shank for a similar price which fell off the bone at the slightest touch from a knife. A litre of sangria was about £12 and went down easily as well.  Service: The friendliest service I have had in a while. Very enthusiastic waitress with plenty of recommendations, smiley but not overly imposing. Only criticism was that we asked for some water twice and it never appeared - luckily we had enough sangria to distract us from that! That said, the staff were warm and friendly from the start until we eventually left.  Ambience: Set in a basement with various alcoves and Morrocan style decor. Tables and chairs were at a very low height but it all contributed to the intimate and lively atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to people who are looking for something a bit different with a fun atmosphere but are also after some genuinely tasty food. 
2	Went for a meal last night and had the set menu, very good value for money and excellent service, would recommend.
2	 Don't be put off by previous bad reviews - whatever problems there were have been long resolved.   I have been numerous times over the last 6 months for the teatime special (£9.95 2 courses) and have been very impressed with the lovely menu (changes weekly), the delicious well presented food and the attentive service. The price is superb and great value.  The chef/owner Tariq is charming and often comes to the front of house to chat to diners - he once cooked for President Clinton and Tony Blair at his local pub in Sedgefield!  Give it a try - you wont regret it :-) 
2	The Atmosphere was great, our food was first class well presented and served. We have been in the past during the week for their fabulous Fish & Chips. and certainly will return.
2	Visited with 10 friends to experience the meat-treat that La Vaca promised.  We were not disappointed!  Mains ranged from a thick 16oz Sirloin and T-Bone Steaks, through the Parrillada (mixed selection with 2no. 8oz sirloins) up to the 24oz pan handle!  All were considerable steaks, quality meat and cooked to our preferences (rare, medium rare, etc).   Great food!
2	 This is a friendly, welcoming pub, and a good location not far off the M56 Hale/Wilmslow junction.  It is part of a huge corporate plc chain - branded as a &quot;chef and brewer&quot; venue, which used to be owned by Spirit Pub Group until their purchase by the Greene King plc empire in 2015. Brand uniformity is very much their thing in their 3,000 pub estate. Our small group enjoyed lunch, and all the staff encountered were helpful and very attentive, although at the time of the visit (a wet Monday lunchtime) the place was very quiet. Food was enjoyable pub grub - we had the chicken burger, cod and chips and a seafood grill. There were three menus to peruse ...a lunch/dinner one, a general all day one and a festive one ...three menus seemed a bit odd, and we couldn't really be bothered, so we quickly focussed on the lunch one. Only one food blemish - chips with everything but we found them tasteless and overheated. Not surprisingly Greene King brands monopolise the drinks choice - the handpulled IPA was acceptably average. 
2	 A very busy place because it's popular and there's a very good menu. The value for money is mixed depending upon what you want, but the daily soups are good and the chicken Caesar salad is delicious. Downstairs is invariably crowded but upstairs affords much more comfort in a relaxed atmosphere 
2	 For a take-away, with a few sit down tables, it looked a bit basic to eat-in. However, the menu is certainly not, and has some great dishes. Being unlicensed, you can bring your own drink as well, which is a bonus. Generous helpings, and friendly service. 
2	 If you like Indian food you cannot go far wrong here, the food is great, cooked to your own liking. The staff are freindly and attentative 
2	 We paid a study visit to Poundbury on a cold windy Saturday morning and this was the first cafe we saw, so walked in. The waiters were in smiles but acted slow and a bit strange. We then realised from the notice board on the table that they were with learning difficulties.  The food was OK and the service was not as professional as you would have in normal cafes, but it made you feel special that somehow you engaged in helping those who needed the opportunity to prove themselves. 
2	 We were eagerly welcomed and a table was quickly found for us even though we hadn't booked. A drinks order was taken and tap water was on the table instantly. The service here was attentive but not imposing. The menu is large and slightly overwhelming but right on cue our waiter stepped in and made some useful suggestions which we accepted. The Antipasti to share was brilliant and our main courses of Veal for me and Spiced Lamb for my partner were also great. This restaurant is definitely owned and run by Italians and something of their culture comes across in the warm ambience and lively atmosphere. A great time was had by us both! 
2	 Didnt eat here but great bar for a few drinks on a Sunday afternoon. Close to Lytham Green , Peroni on draft and a really nice atmosphere. One of the nicvest bars in Lytham. 
2	 Enjoyable night, worth a visit.  Friendly staff and always a great atmosphere and made to feel very welcome. Mixture of different crowds, but everyone gets along.  Also serve supper, which you can't fault. 
2	 I visited here yesterday (Saturday lunchtime) with my mother who was in town - we were attracted by the £7.95 lunch offer.  The service was brilliant and the food was great for £7.95 (Including cover charge of £1) I had a steak topped with chili beans, served with side of jacket potato and small salad, my mother had macaroni cheese.  The service was great the staff couldn't do enough for you and the food was equally as good, highly recommend this place to anyone. 
2	 Recently opened, just behind the sand dunes in Southwold is the Sail loft. Interior is brilliant from a derelict building below sea level they have created a phenomenon. Beer choice is great, even has beers that are not Adnams.....Added to that the wines are good and the food cracking. Had supper there last week and the Steak was perfect, Hake (king of all fish, to me) was nicely cooked and the sauce not overpowering.A really nice evening. Then had breakfast there this morning really tasty coffee, Lowestoft kippers, a flavor that stays with you all day, in a nice way.  This place has just been done well, Loads of thought and no doubt money gone into making it happen. Lovely people, beautifully layed out restaurant and food tops.  This is the East coast so there is no need to rush just sit back and soak it up.... See you there, because I will be back. 
2	My son suggested the Brown Trout Inn as we were on a family visit to him. I think pub carevry grub ok for a fix. Not the case here the food is superb I could not fault it. I had turkey, pork both very tasty and juicy, the vegetable's fresh and cooked just right. The portion is large and the price is very fair. I look forward to our next visit. Thanks to the Brown Trout and thank you for reading my review.
2	 I visited the Dawat recently and the quality of food was far better & more reasonably priced than my previous visit about a year ago. I turns out that there is new management. This restaurant is now well worth a visit. 
2	 I recently visited with friends and was impressed by the overall dining experience. None of the dishes wowed on their own, but the overall experience was very satisfying. This is a confident kitchen that keeps things simple and avoids the cliches that are served in many local Italian establishments. The fact that the small dining room was packed on a Wednesday night is testament to its enduring popularity. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this restaurant was the value on offer with the wine list. So many lovely wines to choose from for under £20 - all Italian naturally. We had a Fruilano and a Sangiovese from Umbria and both were delicious and very reasonably priced. A local restaurant with a deservedly good reputation. It keeps things simple and has an excellent understanding of the 'whole meal' experience. 
2	I've joined friends at the White Horse both at lunchtime and in the evenings. I've never been disappointed and always come away feeling I've had a good time. The staff are wonderfully friendly, but efficient too.  My one comment would be: please offer a wider selection of vegetarian options - especially in place of Sunday Roast.
2	 Sorry but we did not have time to eat here but as a pub it was a nice experience Old and quaint. The beer was great , good service with a smile which can be rare nowadays. Seating outside if you wish .Nice area, just off oxford street but you would not know it sitting outside! Will go again. 
2	 Went once before for the breakfast but was to late. Went back another time for the lunch. Plenty to choose from and a good supply. Nice seating areas, would have liked to have been able to choose where to sit though. Bit of a queue, but could of been bad timing on my part. However, Wasn't keen on seeing people handling some of the crackling and then putting it back!!! Would like to go see how the breakfast but we'll see. 
2	 We were staying at Branscombe, a walk from Beer- for new year. The restaurant was really busy - 2nd January and the weather was lovely so everyone was out and about. We sat outside and had potted crab, scampi and bread and butter pudding- all with Champagne. Fabulous. They were struggling with so many people, but it was totally fine- we didn't need a Michelin service experience! Only think - echoed by others is the 'no under 5's thing' - is it the insurance? have they been sued by someone? Seems crazy to me- and the 'health and safety thing' ?? But do go- we really enjoyed (kids 9,12,12 were elsewhere!) 
2	 Good variety on the menu (improved recently) and good quality food. Very pleasant staff, but service a bit slow at busy times. If you want a good pub meal, it's great. 
2	 The bar a very friendly feel to it making you feel welcome immediately. The staff are very effective providing great service and attention without imposing on you. The food menu was varied and offered big and small meals along with dairy and gluten free option. The food arrived in good time and was very tasty and very hot. 
2	 It's situated really far out the way but if you can be bothered to track it down by following the occasional signs then please do. Cheaper than the White Horse and not any worse, with a queue that's generally shorter, it is certainly worth a visit. 
2	 I often travel to Barnes and I am always on the lookout for great coffee and snacks. Sips & Bites meets my criteria. Friendly Italian staff. Tastiest coffee in Castelnau. Fresh veg, tasty snacks and great service. Pop in during the summer months and enjoy the smoothies. My wife prefers kale. But I enjoy the fruit/ice cream! Well worth a visit if you are in the area! They are expanding and offing more eat in facilities. 
2	 We first came here last October on the recommendation of the taxi driver who collected us from the railway station. He was of Asian origin and was to be eating there himself later that evening. The food was so flavoursome and different to run of the mill Indian food that we made s point of going there again before our next cruise from Southampton. Once again we were greatly pleased with the cooked food but then I made the big mistake of having a dessert. I know they are all usually bought in at Indian restaurants and have had some very nice ice creams before now. Unfortunately the ice cream I ordered was not available so I went for the pistachio kulfi. It was one of the most plastic of ice creams I have had the misfortune to have eaten served with synthetic squirts of cream. A true let down to an otherwise wonderful meal made all the better by being able to sir outdoors. Yes, the service was not quite as attentive as it should have been but the great food was a suitable compensation.   
2	 I have visited this pub quite often and find the staff and locals quite friendly, the decor of the pub in keeping to a fine country pub that lends itself to a spacious extension. So you have a choice to be seated in dimly lit cosy part by a log burning fire or you can be seated in the extension with high ceilings and room for larger groups. The price of drink is a little pricey as an Amstel costs about £3.30 and a Peroni over £4 but service is quick and always with a smile.  I have eaten a range of food including fish which I thought was good and the accompanied veg where fine, especially washed down with a bottle of wine. Although my partner found her steak quite tough on another visit, the Manager was very understanding and refunded the money back for that meal, I must mention I also had steak and mine was fine. The waiting staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough for you and if they were busy and you wanted a drink you only have to take a small trip to the bar as it is generally not that busy except for Friday's and Saturday's evenings. This pub is definitely engaged more towards its food as the bar area is not big, but it has comfortable chairs where you can wait for your table or to read the Observer which the pub provides for free. I've had many good times in this pub and will continue to use it as I believe the team work hard to ensure that everybody has a pleasant experience. 
2	 Drinks and a great time? This is the place! People are vibrant, the drinks are good and it feels authentic. I have been coming here for a few years and its nice to see a place like this. Great place to start the weekend off. 
2	Buzzy local Italian in the Waterloo area. Good food and wine, with very helpful service and timely delivery of the meals.
2	 Me and the wife decided to join the not so insignificant queue outside. After seeing the size of the line we figured it must be good. Boy were we not wrong there.   Fantastic options on offer, some quirky and some traditional dogs on offer. Really nice to see some obscure champers and sparkling wines on offer too.   The dogs were very well executed, with a fantastic amount of toppings. Very nice to see so much care put into their work.  We will definitely be returning on our next visit to London. Maybe try and get a table at their fine dining &quot;Kitchen Table&quot; too. 
2	The Angus steak melts on the palate. Fish and Chips are blue ribbon ratings above others. Curry night invites indian and Brits alike - instead of cooking at home. And the wines, beers, cocktail pitchers - are priced almost as gifts to the customer! If you haven't tried The Red Lion - BEWARE! You cannot stop going back..., see you there.
2	 fantastic food ,fresh crab sandwich in yummy wite bread. Fantastic service and I nice drop of cider from the Bar 
2	 Always a warm welcome in this pub. First rate beers, coffee and tea always available. Excellent choice of pub foods, all sizable portions. A pub full of atmosphere, founded 1717, warm fires, comfortable seating. 
2	I hadn't visited the Compasses in a few years, I stopped in on the drive to visit my brother in Guildford yesterday and was amazed at the changes since my last visit. The place is very clean, freshly painted and offers a choice of restaurant style table service, traditional pub seating in the bar area or their beautiful Garden. The staff were friendly and the cod and chips I ordered was great, and only something like £11.50! My wife ordered the salmon special as well and liked it enough to ask for it to be added to the permanent menu. I will be back next time I head to Guildford for sure.
2	 Very good food, good sized portions, would recommend this place. 
2	 With so many restaurants in London, it can often be quite a risk just to try a restaurant based solely on the look and buzz of it. But that's exactly what we did and we were pleasantly surprised.  We waited about 10 mins for a table (clearly book if you can) and then were seated in a busy but engaging setting. The food was excellent and represented good value for money. Our waitress was very helpful and cheery despite the fact it was clearly very busy!!  Will visit again. 
2	 This is a great little restaurant in Londons Theatre Land - next to Harold Pinter Theatre, we went in after the matinee and got seated and served very quickly by friendly staff and the tapas was very good and reasonably priced. Would definately return! 
2	A group of 8 of us went for a meal on Saturday and was blown away with how good this experience was! We had a range of meals including duck, rib-eye steak and chicken which were all excellent! The drinks were cold and wet also which was great. The manager took a personal approach even complimenting my friend's awful shirt and making him believe he actually looked good which was very kind.
2	 Really nice meal - i had Crab (my first - messy but very tasty). Penny had the special which was Ox liver. Food was very good, very friendly staff and comfortable laid back surroundings. 
2	 Well worth the walk (approx 1 mile) from city centre for authentic Italian cuisine. Busy even at lunch time so service may be a little slow but worth waiting for. Reservations necessary for dinner, but cannot be made for lunch. 
2	 Wasn't quite sure what to expect but really enjoyed the evening. It's basically an eat as much as you like in 2 hours. The idea is pretty simple. You visit the salad/veg bar and the various meat selections are brought to your table. The meat was cooked beautifully. My tip would be to take your time. The tendency is to say 'yes' to everything initially and I will try not to do that next time. The staff are very attentive. I don't like having a service charge added to the bill but you can always deduct it. 
2	 Good food and drink in a good spot with outside drinking and dining space in an open square overlooking the new library complex. 
2	 Conveniently placed beside M5 Junction 23, this is our preferred local venue for good pub food. Friendly, good humoured staff, and great menu choices have meant we have never been disappointed. The fillet steaks, supplied by a local butcher, are superb. The portions are extremely generous, and well cooked. 
2	 I reviewed the Rising Sun Inn shortly after it's new owners took over, in the middle of last year. At the time, I stumbled upon a mess. There were hardly any beers on tap, the food was poor, frozen produce, and the staff weren't welcoming at all.  I returned, hoping for better, in March and was pleasantly surprised. The new owners have invested a considerable sum on levelling out the floor in the bar area, and introduced numerous guest beers from both large and micro breweries. The food, too, looked good - although I didn't stay for dinner.  Still, for lager drinkers this is a not a good bet. San Miguel looks to be the only option... 
2	 Friendly and helpful staff; excellent food and interesting pub menu. Recently refitted it's warm and comfortable. 
2	 birthday meal tonight and as usual the food was excellent, the home made hamburger with hand made chips and onion rigs was very good but maybe cut back on the herb seasoning a bit . My partner had the Northumbrian three cheese soufflé and that was fantastic together with the apple salad . Puddings were tasty and freshly prepared . The bread and butter pudding was especially good. Why only very good instead of excellent ? Mine host could do with cracking a smile at her customers instead of sitting in the corner looking totally hacked off !!!!! 
2	 Excellent lunch for my brothers birthday. Attentive and very helpful staff. Excellent food combined with a great atmosphere led to a very enjoyable lunch. We will be back. 
2	 I visited Cream while on a week long stay at the nearby Butlins with my wife and 2 young children. We visited minehead high street several times, and decided to dine at Cream as the menu offered so much more than almost every other establishments cream tea/traditional pub grub. We orded the filled soda bread ring and it was fantastically different and full of flavours, very inventive. I would recommend Cream if you like modern flavours and something different. 
2	 Second meal here. Very nice pizza and apple crumble (not simultaneously) for me. My friend's chips looked superb....pity I didn't get to try one. Excellent service, and decent wine. Unobtrusive music. what's not to like 
2	 Booked a table for Friday night for 3, place was very busy and service was a little slow because of that, lots of young families so maybe not ideal for couples. Food is what you would expect from a chain restaurant, wine was ok. Great location. 
2	 Full marks to the team at The Mill. Always a warm welcome and several visits later never disappoints. Top tip; ask for their lamb when its on the Special's menu - nearest thing to fillet steak and with asparagus on the side at Just 15.95 a real delight. Our Halloween evng was fully booked but still managed to accommodate us once I threatened to go viral with this scary picture.Best wishes Paul and Mary 
2	this was our first visit & they kept 9 people happy with friendly staff, good food,good service & topped off with reasonable prices,we will be returning
2	 Visited the restaurant with family to celebrate my father in laws birthday, so this was my partner and I first visit. The venue is an old roadside cafe that doesn't look all that great on the exterior but has been tastefully redecorated inside. There are about 40 covers as well as a take away service. The staff are pleasant but although the venue was less than half full it took around 30 minutes for our order to be taken.  When the food arrived it was served on very hot plates ensuring that our meals were hot. There is a reasonably sized menu with a good choice of courses. Although tasty I did feel that my main could have had a wee bit more flavour. But all in all a nice evening, good food and service. 
2	 I love the chicken and atmosphere of Nandos. I wonder what the secret recipe is for their sauces. Its good we can buy it from the shops. Good restaurant. Good value for money. 
2	After the closure of Fuxion in Cheshire Oaks we have been looking for another all you can eat Chinese buffet. We have tried 5 and Sun Ying was recommended to us by a friend. A quick scan of reviews and it didn't look good.  We visited on the 23rd November at 1730, with two adults and two children. We were more than pleasantly surprised to find a clean, presentable seating area. We were shown to our seats by a courteous waitress. Our table and cutlery were clean and drinks orders were placed straight away and within minutes they had been delivered.  Now the food, although I didn't count how many different food stuffs were on offer there seemed to be more than the average all you can eat. The food was presented nicely in separate areas for soup, (very) hot and sour and chicken and sweet corn both delicious, starters, main course and deserts.   Everything we tasted and we tasted everything was hot and high quality. Not just your usual fare of sweet and sour but squid, salt and pepper fish, and our favourite shredded duck.   Deserts were great to, ice cream from a tub but also from a whippy machine with cones, first time I've seen this and the kids loved it. Normal fruit salad, but with lychees and tangerines. Along with this chocolate gateau and fritters.  Although we missed the cheaper lunch time menu, the evening meal at 9.95 per head for adults it is extremely good value.  There was a range of customers but as you are not packed in like pilchards in a tin it was great, if you like people watching it is fun.  Would I recommend it, yes definitely. Is it your typical Chinese buffet no its not, its above average.   Don't think we will look for another unless anyone else knows a little secret
2	 Guest ale was a new one on me so I tried that and wasn't disappointed. The garden was great for a quick beer on the weds night I was pleased to see 20 others had the same idea. 
2	 I feel fortunate to be able to write this review.....we booked last Saturday afternoon and we were squeezed in as the last table available. Our hotel told us a fortnight is normally needed to secure a weekend place....and it's not hard to see why. It could be the wonderful Turkish food (meze & kebabs sounds familiar, but never like this), it could be the intimate, authentic atmosphere (it could be Constantinople under the Ottomans) or the brilliant service (lovely waiters, and then a visit from the chef...). Very much recommended. 
2	 I was walking thru Bolton and happened to come across this little restaurant near the old Ikon nightclub.  Decided to go in and try the food. The interior is nice and clean and the cooking is done in the same room that you eat in.  I ordered Tom Yum chicken soup, which came quickly and had a good spicy flavour. It had plenty of mushrooms and chicken in it.  Next ordered pork Pad Kra Pow with jasmine rice. This is pork with basil, chilli, red and green peppers, and green bean. This came quickly too and was very tasty.  The staff were friendly and the portions were quite large. It would be good if the restauarnt had a lunch-time special offer. 
2	Had a fantastic meal here today. The food was hot and tasty. The service was friendly and attentive. I rarely give a 5/5 unless there's been something exceptional. I'll definitely be going back!!!
2	 i have visited toros with my family very regularly and i am always seated in a booth especially as i have a family of 7, quite a few times we had waited for about 15 minutes but it is a busy restaurant so it is understandable.. we had always been served by the same girl with dark hair, brown eyes and a bubbly personality. she has always made sure our order is perfect and constantly checks we are okay, i had visited again recently with 3 friends and she came right up to me and remembered my meal off by heart which really made my day. The food is always perfect and service is great. Hope to see her again when i return with family! 
2	 Situated in the centre of Chester it is a great place to relax, soak up the architecture and watch the world go by. 
2	I have to admit it, I was expecting the worst when my friend and I stumbled across Red Rose. In all honesty we'd been looking for somewhere else that seems to have disappeared. However, despite the slightly shabby look, the food was top notch. I had the Garlic Chilli Chicken which was delicious and beautifully hot. The naan bread was equally delightful and the rice plump and fluffy. The service was polite and attentive and I left happy and full. I didn't expect such great food (given the appearance of the place), but was very pleasantly surprised.
2	 My wife and I were touring central London on a day out when we came across this restaurant off Tottenham Court Road. The staff were very nice and helpful The first floor restaurant with the roof terrace was very busy but the service was quick and efficient. The Greek food was really good. I would definitely recommend it to others and will be going back. 
4	 Visited here with family on a Monday night for our first time and what can i say, we'll definitely be coming back very soon! We were greeted by the owner Alberto who made us feel very welcome and showed us to our table. The food was consistently brilliant throughout and would highly recommend the Gamberoni Al Limone starter, along with the Filetto Al Pepe for the main course. Everyone loved the food and we all look foward to returning soon. 
4	We go to restaurant a few times in the year with family & friends the food is Always Good and they have good offers from time to time with the Drinks & Food. On Bank Holidays book early.
4	 It was quite busy for week night when I went with my wife. Lovely atmosphere you get the feel of being in Turkey, very pleasant staff and very helpful. The food was much better than what I tried on my visit to Antalya last year. Personally I would definitely visit again , would recommend a visit to anyone who has not been yet. 
4	 Visited the restaurant early on a Saturday evening and was surprised how busy it was. The quality off he food was very good with the serving staff keen to attend and gives good service. Very reasonably priced and will certainly return. 
4	Had lunch here with six old (well, some were not that old!!) work colleagues. The food was generally excellent although the desserts were a little disappointing. Our waitress (Katie) was very friendly and very helpful, recommending an excellent red wine to go with our main courses. The views across the Thames towards the City were a great bonus on top of the meal.
4	If your board of the big high street chain cafés. Give this little Wokingham cafe a chance. Great atmosphere, staff that care and great coffee.  Love the brown bag
4	 I've had a couple of meals here and they've all been great. I can recommend the Fish Cakes, Steak & Ale Pie, Sunday Lunch and Full English Breakfast.  Staff are approachable, attentive and are always willing to help.  The customers and staff make the pub have a friendly, relaxing and welcoming atmosphere whatever the time of day you visit.   Dogs and children allowed in certain rooms.  The courtyard next to the tea rooms is a real haven of a summers evening. Its nice to sit and relax with a bite to eat and bottle of wine.  Highly recommended! 
4	 A lovely atmosphere, very comfortable seats and tables. The staff were amongst the most wonderful in any restaurant we've been to - attentive, extraordinarily friendly, welcoming, and efficient.   The food was sublimely good and a real taste of Nepal, it arrived hot and in good time and there was plenty of it - and at very reasonable prices. The menu is extensive and there is a great selection for vegetarians including some unique Nepalese dishes that are really tasty. If you want to try something a bit different to the usual Indian/Chinese/Italian restaurants, then give this a try.   This is a fantastic place to eat and we cannot rate it highly enough. 
4	Great service, I very much enjoyed the more casual approach.   The food was simply outstanding. The Yorkshire puddings stuffed with beef and bacon were amazing. I had a medium rare ribeye and it's certainly up there with one of the best steaks I've had. The burger with blue cheese dressing was equally as tasty. 100% recommended.
4	 Nice and comfortable chairs and atmosphere, high standard of service and delicious meat cuts as much as you want. The deserts are excellent as well. Highly recommended! 
4	 A friend brought us here for a farewell meal the evening before we moved from Langford to our new home in Devizes and I have only one regret: that we didn't discover the place sooner. Everything was excellent: superb food, and plenty of it; superb service, staff so friendly and welcoming — and to top it all, when Raj, the proprietor, realised it was our farewell meal he surprised us with a complimentary bottle of Martini to celebrate in our new home! Raj, we raised a glass to you and we'll gladly raise another: long may you and your business thrive! 
4	 Have known this little restaurant and Rubin the owner for over 20 years but used only occasionally. Very surprised last night that we had such a fantastic meal there had to write in. We will be back for more.  Had Scallops, Prawns and Sea Bass with Pad Thai. Excellent!  I can honestly say this was the best meal in years and made a refreshing change to usual restaurants around Andover. 
4	I make the argument unreservedly. I have eaten in restaurants five or more nights a week for the last two years, always in search of the best and most delectable, the most interesting and important. And I have come back again and again to Joe's because it produces A very interesting menu complimented with great service and an excellent wine list.  I highly recommend Joe's as one to visit because It always has an unbeatable atmosphere and a great selection of live entertainment in the evenings on weekends
4	 we went to the island pool christmas eve,it was nice to see a full house enjoying a full breakfast,as always lovely food plenty of choice ,go back for seconds if you want to.staff were very helpful and brilliant value at 3.95p,made a nice start to the christmas holidays and all the best for 2014. 
4	Less than 5 minutes' walk from Bolton train station is a great little cafe that provides delicious grub. Completely vegetarian, with plenty of vegan options, this eatery serves ethically sourced, fairly-traded, organic food and drink. Non-veggies need not worry about being given a plate of strange beans and a glass of lukewarm water, this places has a very wide choice of meals, from all-day breakfasts all the way through to moussakas, omelets, curries and lasagnes, to name but a few. A good selection of puddings, too, and not just carrot cake (although the slice I had today was really tasty). There's no license, but there is an Interesting array of bottled/carton cordials, colas and juices. The kitchen area is open and the staff are friendly and polite. There are plenty of leaflets on display advertising upcoming events in and around Bolton and lots of information on organic food and green issues generally. There is a disabled access toilet, which is clean and tidy.
4	 This has taken me a while to write, we were on a business trip to London, staying at the Megaro hotel-see separate review. It was the end of March and the weather was baltic, extremely cold. The wife sent me to find somewhere nice to eat, preferably Italian. Just round the corner, thankfully I came across a few restaurants but the one that caught my eye was Casa Mamma. We went there for a meal, the house wine-red- highly recommended. The meal was good and the prices were were very good. Would highly recommend. The waiters were friendly and there was a good atmosphere. I took the card with name of restaurant but mislaid it and just found it-thereby the long time in submitting this review. 
4	My lads took me here for my birthday. On entering the restaurant I thought that the decor wasn't the usual norm for a tandoori. I especially liked the lighting, very warm and homely. The waiters were polite, well dressed and were at hand when needed. The food was original and fresh, tasty and spiced exactly to my liking. We enjoyed a lovely meal and there was plenty of drink and laughter. The owner, Mr. Money even came and greeted me especially for my birthday towards the end of the evening, and let us continue our party till our drinks were finished even slightly after closing hours!!! All in all I will definitely be going back to the Harlington Tandoori for its food and service and I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends or family looking to spend an evening out or spend a special occasion somewhere.
4	 Met up with 2 friends for an early evening meal, we have eaten here before, the food has always been excellent, but Thursdays meal was amazing! 2 of us had meals from the specials menu the other from the main menu and after having drinks by the lovely huge warming fire, we were taken into the dining room and meals were already on table. It was a wow from all of us how the food was presented only to be followed up with us all agreeing that the food was not only good portions, but tasted incredible at the end of the evening I spoke to the chef and told him how good our dining experience had been. Highly recommended 
4	 The Culbone is nestled at the top of Porlock Hill on the main road. If you are passing or if you are in the area you really must pay this establishment a visit.  We live in Gloucestershire, but we have driven down for the day just to have and enjoy what can only be described as first class food and first class service.  Although some staff have left over the years, Lesly and the team continue to ensure that quality is not compromised in any way shape or form.  Ive classed the Culbone as one of the best meals I have ever had in a restaurant, and believe me we have eaten in many, both in the UK and around Europe.  Although we last visited in January 2015, its just been down to other commitments that has stopped us from going there more often this year, but rest assured as a well know person has be known to say &quot;we'll be back&quot; 
4	 I had the Smoked Brisket and my girl freind had the Piggy Back Burger, we also had fries and the BBQ Slaw, along with a Kiss Me Kate cocktail and it was all extreemly nice! Big portions too! Only slight bad points were cards we not accepted and the toliets need some work to bring up to the excellent standard of the bar and restaurant 
4	 It's testamount to how good this cafe is that there have been at least 10 different cafes in these premises over the years and 'The Coffee Shop' is the only one good enough to have lasted longer than 6 months.  The breakfasts here are superb with proper crispy bacon, meaty/herby sausages and a choice of poached, scrambled or fried egg - all done to perfection - which is hard to find in a standard greasy spoon. At only £4.95 for a big breakfast they are value for money too.  Staff are very friendly, always willing to chat and tailor your meal exactly how you would like it. The Coffee Shop also scores highly for it's range of 'non-breakfast' choices with steak baguettes and sausage and chutney baguettes being particular favourites.  Eat here most weekends and wouldn't even consider another cafe in birkenhead now 
4	 another visit to a brilliant restaurant - lovely food and really good value. had the £12 two course meal because we were full and couldn't make the third. course. .Wonderful terrine (and huge) with poached egg to start followed by a beautifully cooked gammon steak with mash and green cabbage. All washed down by some great beer. What more can one want!!!!. This restaurant just goes from strength to strength. 
4	Really can't fault this experience. Have been twice on business and with family.   Recently refurbished and very varied menu; praise for the Caesars Salad and the pea risotto as well as burger. Pear sorbet lovely.
4	Me and my family have been coming to Newquay for the last 10 years every summer and now live here.  We only eat Indian from this restaurant and have become good friends with the people who work there  The food is second to none,always friendly,always on time.
4	 Memorable visit, outstanding cream tea, fascinating setting in the historic house, better than most national trust house cafés, and my wife and I have visited many. Mouth watering cream tea served on antique china which was well suited to the atmosphere of the place. My wife and I have lived in Enfield for fifteen years and we are pleased there is a new cafe we can look forward to visiting regularly. 
4	 Excellent coffee, lovely cakes and always served with a smile. Home from home feeling every time we visit. Thank you 
4	 Highly recommended had my sisters 50th birthday with the family. Lots of atmosphere good service food choice and quality 4****. Have been before and will go again nice for a cosy meal as well as a special event. Thanks Bistro 42 
4	 We booked a table at Dr. Feelgood’s on Thursday (17/10) for a special occasion, we were celebrating 1 year to go till me and my partner get married! We chose the Dr’s as we are getting married at Newton Hall which is owned by the same company so felt it was the perfect place to go. When we arrived we were warmly greeted by an older gentleman who looked after us all night and I’ve got to say he was brilliant from start to finish. At this point we have to thank Dr. Feelgood’s as they had a complimentary bottle of prosecco ready for us as it was a special occasion.  Food wise we managed to settle on 3 dishes each however we could of ordered a lot more. Dishes that we ordered were the pork san choy bau, popcorn chicken, albondigas, pulled pork flatbread, patatas bravas and flash fried prawns. We generally enjoyed all of the dishes particularly the pulled pork flatbread but sadly we couldn’t finish it all as we were to full.   After food we then decided to take a good look at the drinks menu which I must say is pretty impressive. The selection of cocktails and beers from around the world is fantastic and for the rest of the night we managed to sample quite a few. The highlights being ‘The Cookie Monster’ and the sharing ‘Zombie’ which certainly had a kick to it!  Overall great atmosphere and talented staff set in a really funky looking venue that delivers great food and as an impressive drinks list I have seen in any bar. Give it a try you won’t be disappointed! 
4	 Our first visit was for an evening meal after a long day at Shanklin. Trip advisor search for best restaurants in Shanklin made us take the walk from the seafront up to Fine Nammet, and we are so very glad we did. This is not rated the #1 restaurant in Shanklin by chance!   Food was beyond fantastic, very tasty with outstanding presentation. Fish cooked perfectly and the table water with fruit and cucumber was a lovely, refreshing touch. The service from entrance to exit was of the highest calibre, very attentive yet never pushy. Coffee was really nice and my girlfriend loved her decaf tea (served without bag in the water and milk on the side which is how it should be!). Coffee would be perfect if a flatwhite was available! :)   We've eaten at a lot of places this week and Fine Nammet is miles ahead of the competition, it is a must if you enjoy food and we returned for lunch a few days after, see our second review - Tom & Zanti 
4	 If you can possibly make it - do try to get to Santa Maria Del Sur at least once. I can only say it's the best steak in England, but I'd be surprised if there were many to beat it anywhere. 
4	 Very good service, great staff, lovely atmosphere and very good food. We arrived early sat by the bar and had a drink. Went to our table and ordered. I ordered the roast lamb and my friend ordered chicken which was not on the menu, but the chef was happy to cook it for her. The lunch was just great. Pudding was its equal. I am definitely going back soon. Not cheap but worth every penny. Its a pity they are not open for Christmas day. Thank you for a great lunch. 
4	 Definitely going back to the artesian well, great place for a night with friends and dancing. Friendly staff and good drinks prices, my new favourite place. 
4	 We didn't fancy queuing for an average Cornish pasty, so we dropped in on this little cafe just off of the main thoroughfare in Looe. We'll definitely be going back, because the food, service and value were all brilliant! 
4	 Really tasty sandwiches at a fair price - much better than the chains. I always go there when in the area. 
4	 Despite what we had heard, not difficult to find. The entrance is through a menswear shop! The restaurant is light and bright (we went for lunch) somewhat quirky decoration but it works. The service was very slick, the staff very informative and the food was exemplary, very innovative and excellent quality. The wine list was good for whites and sparkling/champagne but could be a little more extensive in the reds. Many dishes appeared to use local produce. It would be difficult to describe as British or European, the cuisine is very individual to Michael O'Hare's style. 
4	 I came here a couple of times with family while my wife was at Southmead Hospital. We were greeted with a very warm welcome and treated to some very good food. The staff were very polite and helpful and the landlord was particularly welcoming. If we're ever in Bristol again I wouldn't go anywhere else. 
4	 I've been coming to this bar for the best part of 5 years now and have a great night out each time I come here.   The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and provide quick yet engaging service. This also includes the door staff who make sure everyone has a good evening in a safe and secure environment!  The music is varied including hits from the chart as well as the club classics and has the widest range of drink choices I have ever seen in a bar!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The recent refurb makes it one of the classiest bars in town with new lighting and sound equipment as well as nice toilet facilities and comfortable furniture.   I've also had many birthdays here and had some of the best nights out at this bar. Great VIP service where they make you feel really welcome and take care of you and the rest of your party.   To sum up Missoula Romford is the ideal place to go with your mates for a casual drink but also for those big celebrations! Don't forget to try a few cocktails from their extensive list and also there amazing meal choices! 
4	 Fantastic little place, food was amazing. I had the Mexican Beef Lasagne and not only was it massive, but tasted wonderful. 
4	WE popped in there on a rainy Thursday, received a great welcome. Starters were great (crab cakes) we both had the goulash which was superb and plenty of it! My wife finished with a creme brulee and me th efantastic local cheese board!
4	Great start to the weekend. well cooked, good service, value for money. Varied choice on the menu with some interesting options.
4	 I booked the ‘historic’ globe room at Ye Olde Reinedeer Inn for a works social event. Communication was excellent both pre-event and during. The room and tables were set-out immaculately and the food and service that evening could not have been better. The staff were extremely courteous and accommodating, the home-made food was delicious, served exactly on time, piping hot and without any hiccup or mishap, and bearing in mind there were 20 of us was impressive. In fact the evening could not have gone any smoother thanks to the helpful and very professional staff at Ye Olde Reinedeer Inn. Unbelievably good value for money and a great selection of beverages to boot. We will certainly be venturing there again in the not so distant future. Thanks for a great evening. 
4	 fast wholesome food.friendly .easy to get there.Clitheroe is a small place.Easy Part Of Clitheroe.Near Exit From Clitheroe Castle.Near St JamesJuniorSchool 
4	 We've eaten here three times in the last few months and haven't been disappointed with anything. We'll be back again to try more of the unusual items on the menu (there's so much more to Indian food than chicken tikka, good though that is!). 
4	 Chris ( My wife ) and myself had been traveling for a while and hungry, we saw the hotel sign and even though itm was off our route we needed a break so we headed to the Joiers Arms. Well we both think we were meant to find this jewel, Chriss had the Lamb as it was late in the afternoon we thought we would not have a choice of dinner, We were wrong, Even though the Joiners Arms was full, ( found out later on a large birthday party was on the go )  The staff soon cleaned a table for us as a large family had just left as we came in , and we were made ever so welcome by a young gentleman who was looking after the tables and the bar and the barman, ( both who were very busy same as the girls who were serviceing ). We both got differant meals, i had the Pork and Chriss had the Lamb, We eat out a lot and sometimes we see plates just piled on and we dont realy like that all the time. When the meals came we were very pleased to see a oblong plate with for me lovely fresh pork with just enough potatoe not a big pile, lovely baby carrots, gravy in a bowelall you would expect with a Pork dinner, presention was perfect. Chriss had lamb and her meal was the same, every thing was perfect, food was enough but not forceing itself off the plate. Presention as perfect, well done cheff.  We have saved this village on our sat as we travel around Nortumberland a lot, We will be back. Again i will point out how good the staff were, Cheerfull and from what i could see ( I have worked in hotels for Bass and Toby for many years as well as private hotels ) as i watched them with children they could not do enough to make the childs visit a good visit as well,, as as past manger that was good to see.  Dennis 
4	 Feeling weary and wanting an interesting light lunch we chanced upon The Living Room in Oxford City's Castle Complex. Three excellent &quot;tapas sized&quot; savoury dishes of Crab cakes, Duck filled Spring Rolls and Scallops done three ways washed down with Prosecco and an English sparkling wine sated us but we could not resist a platter with samples of all their puddings. Great service, Great staff, great food. We left refreshed and will return to try some of the other dishes 
4	I arrived late one evening and was made to feel most welcome. The food was delicious and the cocktails were out of this world. It's a shame it's not open later for those sho don't want to be crammed into one of the various 'cattle markets' located nearby.
4	 Beautiful food and great menu choices. We were a party of 10, including 2 children, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. Very friendly, efficient service. The Inn is quite small but has a lovely atmosphere, with refreshingly un-cluttered decor. Good to find another pub in the area serving super local produce cooked perfectly. Thank you for a super evening, we shall certainly be back 
4	 Owned and run by the peope who work there.... or that's how it appears. Not too many left to enjoy. Our second visit which was as good as the first. The lamb and the duck were excellent. Probably need to book at around 7.30 as it got busy. 
4	 Had heard a lot of hype about the Ivy,yet an unimpressive outside and a warm almost old pub-like interior. What impressed was the absolutely fantastic service and food par excellence. A rather trying booking system to test the customer,but worth the battle. 
4	 I hosted my family and friends at this restaurant on December 8th, a party of 9. The meal we enjoyed was beautifully prepared and our favourite dishes, carapaccio, risotto and veal scallopini were all spot on. With great Sicilian Chardonnay and reasonably priced Amarone we had a great time. 
4	 I chanced upon this place when I was looking for something to eat at about 9 o'clock on Saturday morning. There was a varied menu. I chose bruschetta all'aglio. It was freshly and quickly prepared and was only £3.99. I also had a large hot chocolate with cream. Everything was delightful. 
4	This genuine Thai restaurant we go to every time we come back to Otley. Added bonus is you can take your own booze. Love it!
4	 Went here on Friday night for my mums 50th birthday. The food was great, service was great and the whole place had a great feel to it. The staff made us feel really welcome. Very reasonably priced too. 
4	Great Turkish restaurant .... Wouldn't go anywhere else!! Staff there are great too would highly recommend for all occasions!!
4	 We really enjoyed afternoon tea with finely cut sandwiches on really fresh bread, homemade scones & a selection of lovely cakes. I bake myself and am usually let down by cakes when I'm out but these were lovely and light.   The price is good and the food is nice. The location is ideal if you've visiting Paignton as it's right on the seafront opposite the crazy golf.  We ate with other friends who also enjoyed their open sandwiches. The menu is plenty big enough for everyone to find something they'd enjoy. I found the menu on line on their website.  The café was completely full whilst we were there which is always a good sign. Their reputation is obviously already spreading. We look forward to returning next time we're in Paignton - as long as we can get in! 
4	 Took the other half here for her birthday and I have to say we were both mightily impressed. We had a meze sharing platter with the wonderful puffed up breads followed by a salad each. The food was outstanding and we are both real foodies so we know what we're talking about.  The staff were courteous and professional. Service was quick, yet not rushed.  I'd recommend this place to families and couples. Beautiful. See you again soon! 
4	Excellent lunch with good size portions, superb range of real ales and a great pub atmosphere. Will definitely go back again.
4	 This is a really nice little restaurant. I really liked the decor, the service was very friendly and efficient, but the outstanding thing was the food. I had 'the Georgian' breakfast - it was simply outstanding - tasty and filling. 
4	 Nothing negative to say about this establishment. The quality of food linked with a very reasonably priced menu with plenty of choice makes this a must to any visitor to Ambleside 
4	 This place was recommended by Wakefield racegoers at Aintree last week. It exceeded all expectations.The naans were excellent,The portion sizes and quality of starters and main courses were generous.This was Kashmiri food at its best 
4	 This is an excellent pub with great food and good beer. The service is very good. The food is better than normal pub food with a good menu with specials. 
4	 My wife and I went twice in June to Casa Pepe as we had been there last year and enjoyed it then. Nothing has changed thank goodness, from the moment you are greeted to the end of your dining there, the whole time spent is relaxed and not fussed over or rushed by those serving you. The food is well worth the money, with either main menu/set menu or specials board to choose from. We had a selection from the main menu one night and a set menu another- both meals could not be faulted for their portions nor their quality in taste and presentation. Well done again Casa Pepe in keeping your standards high and giving the customer full value for their money, and we will certainly go next year when in the area 
4	 A brilliant evening had by me and my partner; the food was excellent, well prepared and presented, there was a wide range of both draught and bottled beers, and the staff were very helpful, attentive and cheerful. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys good food, good drinks and a very welcoming atmosphere. 
4	 Excellent food which was very well presented and the service was exceptional. We had a fantastic time. 
4	 I have frequented the Wood Farm Brewery from the first day it opened. Being a bitter drinker it is heaven. I am a dedicated 'No.8' fan. It may not have your strong dark bitters but what is on offer will be more than adequate. The brewery is always busy and at the end of the day it's bums on seats that count and so many patrons cannot be wrong! The food is excellent and the menu varied. What you pay for is what you get. If you want the Savoy, go to the Savoy! The service is excellent and the staff helpful and courtious. At times it can be busy but thats the price you pay for being in a good establishment. I will continue to give the Wood Farm my patronage and if you haven't tried it, then I urge you to give it a go. You won't be disappointed. 
4	 They have recently reworked the menu and the food is so much better. The area is beautiful as it is surrounded by woodlands.  A great pub to go for a pint or go for a meal. 
4	 Having used this restaurant as both eat in and takeaway, I can honestly say it is the best oriental cuisine in town. Not too many dishes on the menu (always a good sign), and the food is freshly cooked to order. My favourite dish is the Randang Curry, simply gorgeous! 
4	 Had a fantastic breakfast here and some really good cakes, will be back again for some treats for the family!! 
4	 Very good food very good price and not poor quality like other places. Lots of choice good atmosphere 
4	 Sat at the very table last night from which the Trip Advisor main photo was taken!  This is a very comfortable restaurant in a convenient location, and although there are tables outside, the fact that one whole corner of the place can be opened to the elements in such stiffling weather conditions as yesterday, made it the perfect place for a chilled-out early evening meal.  Not exactly crowded when we went, but this only led to an unrushed, well-prepared meal, served by attentive staff. The owner, Jordan, is particularly affable and enthusiastic.  The backgound music matched the laid-back ambiance, and we could have stayed there much longer than return trains allowed.  A very clean and well-set-out restaurant; we will return, and this time may very well visit the &quot;haunted&quot; bar area downstairs! 
4	 Friends booked a meal at the Green Pea for a Friday evening. Having never heard of the restaurant, I had a quick look at the website which I'm afraid to say was rather uninspiring. I then looked at the trip advisor reviews which suggested that this place was definitely worth a visit. We were NOT disappointed! Mine host Tom is full of the Irish charm and banter and makes even the simple task of ordering your meal fun. I would definitely go again as the food is excellent (and also very good value) but it is Tom who makes the evening ! Just goes to show that you should never judge a book by its cover as you would probably drive past this restaurant if looking for somewhere to eat. Definitely one to try!! 
4	 I went here on Saturday night for my neices birthday and had a very nice night, the food and service is excellent and reasonably priced. the waiters are very friendly and helpful and thanks to Niz for a good night we will be back again very soon. 
4	 Everything was perfect even the weather will certainly visit again a varied menu beautifully presented will meet all tastes 
4	 We have now made this a regular spot for a meal out when we visit family in Bowness , althought you are charged 'city centre' prices the food is always high quality served hot and with a friendly smile even at really busy times. I would always advise booking particularly at peak season and weekends , its always busy and popular with locals and returning tourists alike . Its directly across the road from the cinema so its handy for pre /post film eats. Specials board changes every time we have been and its pretty much a standard Italian menu otherwise but as I said its cooked well and portion sizes are generous and I strongly recommend the spare ribs in a very rich dark sauce , they are to die for. The only limitation I feel needs looking at is the choice of beer , but hey its a minor thing . Try it once , you will return I gaurantee. 
4	When you approach The Vine from the outside, you wonder whether you've found the right place. But whilst it looks like a dive of a pub in industrial wasteland on the outside, it's wonderful on the inside and the food and prices are superb. We came on a family visit and agreed that the curries were among the best we've had. Very decent service too!
4	 Without doubt the best value and best tasting chips in Ashford with a &quot;pensioner deal&quot; at lunchtimes as well. Very well mannered staff and obviously very popular with the local secondary school 
4	 The food is incredible! It's fresh and made to order in front of your eyes. Incredible food and Niraj is brilliant with all of his customers, hence why they just keep going back. Keep up the good work! James C 
4	 My mother and I visited this restaurant on a one off trip to Brighton and we are glad that we did!  The restaurant is homely and welcoming and the staff are amazing, the waiter who served us was friendly and knowledgable and explained the menu thoroughly.   Upon his recommendation, we opted for the tapas for two offer which came with chunky chips and wine.   The whole menu looked amazing and we wanted to try everything so the tapas was the perfect option.   The food was delicious, imaginative and beautifully presented.   The portions are very generous but we couldn't miss dessert and we chose the triple dip churros. The churros came with a cherry compote, chocolate and molten caramel dip. I must say that this was the best dessert I have had in years  and is well worth the calories!  Terre a Terre is the best vegetarian restaurant that I have visited and is made excellent by the standard of food and the genuinely lovely, attentive and enthusiastic staff.   It's the only place to eat in Brighton in my opinion! 
4	 Enjoyed a well cooked meal, overlooking the Cathedral to end what was a very enjoyable day in Exeter. Fortunately It wasn't too busy, so it was fairly quiet and the service was very good. 
4	 We were staying in a lodge at Pound Farm (see review) and decided to have a meal at the Sun Inn n the village,  Pleasant traditional pub with a separate dining room. Service was good; good menu with reasonable prices. I had the Lamb Shank - very nice indeed - while my wife had a chicken dish which she very much enjoyed.  Thoroughly recommended!  
4	 This really is the best Thai take away I've ever had. Food is restaurant quality and there is a wide range of delicious dishes not on offer at other take aways. Can't recommend enough. 
4	 Seems just like an old pub but the food is certainly not pub-grub. Really interesting menu. We had octopus, a leek concoction and spicy aubergine to start followed by a wonderful Pheasant pie for two and a gorgeous Duck. Arrived at 6pm as dinner starts and restaurant full by 6.15pm. So others know how good this is. 
4	We went to look at a 2 property upscale development being built in the village (already sold, but we wanted a look anyway). Feeling hungry we saw the Blagdon Inn, noted the car park was busy, a good sign, so popped in for lunch. We were greeted warmly by Willow and directed to a table by the large inglenook. Drinks arrived promptly and we were left to study the menu - and a very interesting menu it is, featuring a wide range of imaginatively presented locally sourced produce. We had Kalamata olives and Almonds (spiced, baked and glazed) while we made our choice. We shared the mussels with leeks cooked in cider followed by the Aged Dexter beef burger, and the Tarka battered plaice - both were excellent. For dessert we had vanilla pannacotta with English cherries - again excellent, and made a request for the strawberry and almond Eton Mess to be with out cream (not a problem and again delicious). Interestingly we overheard Willow discussing up coming bookings in the diary and noted that one party had requested 1 non-dairy and 1 gluten free. We finished with a coffee done the way I like it and a green tea. The bill came to under £70, including 4 drinks which we felt was very good value (I actually thought they had missed something off and checked it, but no, all there). We liked the idea of the seasonal 'Beer Snacks' - 17 smaller dishes to choose from if you pop in for a drink and are feeling peckish but don't want a full meal. Although this is clearly a restaurant in the countryside where booking ahead would be advisable, it also caters to a walk-in trade. If you want to survive and thrive as a country pub you need to cover both bases well and we felt the Blagdon Inn achieves this.  We were impressed with the menu and liked the staff so we have booked for an evening meal next week and will report on this too.
4	 I found this pub to be very friendly the food was outstanding and it was very reasonably priced if I am in this area again I will come back here without a doubt 
4	Love this place, family owned and run. Never seen it less than full. Pizzas were great, staff so helpful, welcoming and friendly. Forget the pizza resturant chains - come here.
4	 If you want to have an excellent three course lunchtime Italian meal from a varied menu and have a good quality wine, in a warm and welcoming restaurant, with first class staff and to finish off picking from a lovely range of home made sweets from &quot;the trolley&quot; and all for around £25 per head, look no further than Villa Marina restaurant right on the river front in Henley on Thames. Because of its location there is no associated car parking but that said it is easily within a short walk of ample car parking in the town and is well worth doing. All seven of us remarked on the excellent meal and service even though they were busy. The family and I will certainly be back there when we are next down visiting our relatives in the area. PS If the Villa d'Este in Marlow is anything as good as Villa Marina you could try there as well. Villa Marina - grateful thanks for an excellent meal, at a great price, in lovely welcoming surroundings. 
4	 Having been invited to have dinner with some new friends i was looking forward to trying this place despite living not far had not managed to fit in a visit . I certainly wished i had been before because i was actually surprised at the warmth and friendlyness of the staff from the manageress Kellie right through the staff the food was well cooked and presented if i did have any gripes at all it would be the lack of staff behind the bar when we arrived (early) for our booking maybe it was a shift change but had to wait and had the usual thing nowadays of people diving in for service instead of waiting their turn but this did not detract from the overall experience one bit . 
4	 I'm a regular in Uni Kebab not only for their excellent food (my personal favorite: meaty feast with jalapeños!) but their service. Always friendly, efficient and fast makes Uni Kebab the best option for the student with no time to waste and to be able to relax and have a wonderful food. I totally recommend to stop by and try one of the many excellent dishes they offer. Even for those picky vegetarians and people that don't eat eggs can have a great food. 
4	 This was the first time i went to Shapla Indian restaurant in Woodbridge ipswich with my family as it was recommended via a friend. Food was really nice. Your waiter (Sab Ali) gave us an excellent service couldn't of asked for more, the young lad,was a happy and cheerful lad and really smiley at all times, and really friendly, which was good. It was really nice to speaking to him, So defiantly would reconmend this place and come back. 
4	 Nice place and friendly staff ;. The brekkie is good and so is the cost , its a bit off the main road so get asking for it and you wont be disappointed ,. sit outside if you want in the sun 
4	 Great menu with lots of choices, great food to look forward to, friendly helpful staff always looking after you, always book here when visiting Bristol. Not expensive. 
4	 A fantastic place to eat and given its location just across the road from the hotel easy to get to. The staff are very pleasant and will do everything they can to make your visit enjoyable. The food was superb with a mushroom risotto that would be hard to beat. The lemon tart for dessert was worth the visit on it's own and I wouldn't fail to recommend this restaurant to anyone or to return when in Leeds. If you're looking for a leisurely meal and a long stay then beware you only get the table for 2 hours and then they're pretty hot on moving you from the table. 
4	 A must to visit when in Norwich, traditional pub with traditional features and a beer garden like no other. Good cross section of visitors. Real Ale and great traditional food. 
4	 We tried this and definitely best Indian in the UK I've had by a country mile. Authentic Indian food as supposed to the rubbish that 99% of Indian restaurants seem to serve that bears no resemblance to Indian food at all (No sign of a korma or balti on the menu!!). The flavours at Chilli Pickle are brilliant. The menu is quite small but then is normally a good sign - as the dishes that they do were all fantastic. Combined with a really good atmosphere I'd highly recommend this to anyone. 
4	 Fantastic food that is competitively priced! A must visit! So good in fact, we had to return the following week, this time it was take away! 
4	 I've written about Cafe Masala only recently but as I'm here on business regularly I'm a frequent visitor. I've just totalled the current scores and almost 91% of visitors scored it as either Very Good or Excellent and I'm one of those! Really nice people, very clean restaurant, excellent food and great service. I'm back in Kidderminster in 2 weeks time, will I be in Cafe Masala? Yes I absolutely will and if you have any sense you will be as well' 
4	 Without a doubt my birthday this year was made all the more enjoyable not only because of the fine company I kept but the establishment we decided to venture to. The Penn Inn has been a frequent haunt for quizzes and meals however the birthday meetup was significantly fantastic due to the atmosphere of the Inn and the wonderful Mangeress who ensured that we had a great night . Currently I am in a Slimming World dietary regime which means that sometimes the choice of food is drastically reduced however the lady in charge (being a previous member of the same club) understood full well the situation I was in and offered me a meal that was not only syn free but soooo yummy. My birthday was made all the better by having a full meal in the company of those i love in a place that has a homely feeling to it. Thankyou xxx 
4	 Popped in for a late lunch and were delighted the find them open and serving. The atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect and could not be closer to the source of delicious seafood. We both had the Seafood and Shell Fish Soup special which was delicous and loaded with mussels, prawns, clams and scallops. Came with really lovely bread, chips and a glass of crisp white wine. The welcome and service from Helen was wonderful. We will go back soon 
4	 visited Kumars last Friday just 3 of us for friends 60th food was excellent and the service great they even put some balloons up .small stars on table and brought a small cake and candle.a real treat for out friend would visit again ,one of the group even took takeaway for the his wife so impressed. 
4	 Had a lovely meal, here. Excellent food, Great Value. Lovely selection of beers, but I was driving.  The Staff were Friendly, and very patient.  Cannot recommend them more highly. 
4	 We love Cafe Spice Namaste This time was a little different, we brought our parents to experience all our favourite London things to do. What warms our heart is that even though our visits are often 6 months apart, the staff, Cyrus and his beautiful wife Pervin always remember us. I had the lamb dosa and Parsee chicken delicious. We eat low carb but always allow ourselves to indulge at Cafe Spice.  Hubby had chicken from the Parsee new year menu and the pork vindaloo. The rest of the family asked for our advice, and thoroughly enjoyed the beetroot and coconut samosa, chicken tikka with the most amazing tarka dhal and a prawn curry. With a little nann to share we had a wonderful evening. Cyrus came to say hello, and co side ring he had been at Saturday Kitchen to present the show with Tony Singh that morning, nobody could have blamed them for taking the evening off. The only problem we have, no matter how we try, we cannot convince them to relocate to our hometown of Leicester.  The food, the staff, the owners and the service are amazing, and for our party of 5, the bill was £100 cheaper than anywhere else we have dined this weekend  I even managed a chat with the chef who makes the dosa the night before when we left the lovely little pub next door and he was leaving work for the evening.  We have previously partaken in the taster menu also, for a one off visit I'd highly recommend it, but make sure you are hungry, you will have never eaten sooooooooo much amazing food 
4	 Popped in for drink and tapas, food superb, beautiful wine , staff so attentive and very professional, well worth the award of Best Spanish place to eat and drink in Birmingham.  A must try for all. 
4	Visited with a party of us through work - we were all very impressed service was excellent and efficient. The food was best we have eaten, fresh and full of flavour. Can't wait to go back, highly recommend Duke Bombay Cafe!
4	 Friendly, traditional chip shop. Good selection of meal deals on offer and the specials that are on are always something a bit different, home made and delicious. I have yet to try the sunday dinner, they come highly recommended. 
4	Just completed the 8-day South Downs Way walk, which brought with it the obvious necessity to have daily pub lunches en-route to refuel - which for the most part ranged from okay to pretty good - but this was the undoubted highlight and strong contender for 'meal of the trip'.  All 3 of us opted for the home-made burger, so whilst we can't testify to the breadth of the menu, the home-made hamburger was up there with the best that I've ever eaten, and certainly every bit as good as those available at the various 'gourmet burger' joints around the place these day.  Normally I don't booze at lunch time, just because I struggle to move thereafter (a shade inconvenient on a walking holiday), but the delicious, well-kept light ale on draft (sorry, name eludes me...) was so good that myself and my friends all cheerfully indulged before fortifying ourselves with good strong coffee.  Sat next to cool-looking old well shaft in the corner of the pub, in which you can chuck your change if you're that way inclined, though it's probably fairer to leave it as a tip!  Landlord (dead-ringer for comedian Mark Thomas) seemed like a very nice, down-to-earth fellow, and we left suitably cheered, sated, and a fair bit slower than when we came in. Well done & many thanks.
4	 We visited for lunch on Friday and the three of us, all with differing tastes found something on the menu to delight the tastebuds. The meat, well especially the pork crackling was sublime - the fish was fresh and perfectly cooked. We each had three courses, all different and all tried each others. The presentation was as good as the taste. I've forgotten to mention the great friendly, jovial service we had - lovely lunch - nice find!! 
4	 We knew from the moment we reserved the table that we would be in for a treat. We were due to visit the cinema for 7.30pm & knew that we wanted to give ourselves plenty of time to enjoy our visit to this Bistro!! Our host prepared our visit with precision & professionalism. He suggested we arrive at 5.30/5.45 whereupon our table would be waiting. The restaurant was surprisingly busy & there was a real vibe. His extremely courteous staff provided us with drinks immediately upon our arrival, displaying a thorough knowledge of our time schedule & seemlessly directed us to the comprehensive 'specials board', whilst not noticeably rushing us.  We both choose the scallops, with the roasted hake to follow. Both dishes were exquisite in both taste & presentation. The staff were attentive & charming, clearly indicating to us that they enjoyed their roles.  Our meal experience was performed to an exceptional high standard & had we been in a theatre we would have given them a standing ovation!!!! I completely understand why you are rated so highly in the area. Your competitors will have a hard act to follow. 'Bravo to you all' 
4	 We came for a friends birthday and without any fuss they sat us at the best table with extra decorations.   The food was excellent value and the waiter could not have been more helpful. A really friendly environment. 
4	 I visited Giuseppe's restaurant last Thursday with my husband. I enjoyed the warm atmosphere and the service.  My lamb was extremely tasty and full of flavour. All the meals were delicious . Would highly recommend 
4	We celebrated our Ruby Wedding with a lunch party for 50 people in the Kitchen Garden Restaurant. Absolutely every aspect, right from our initial inquiry to the actual provision on the day, were handled with superb professionalism and a clear desire to please. The day itself exceeded our every hope and expectation - allowing us to enjoy the event totally ourselves - knowing our guests were all happy and being well looked after by such excellent staff.  If there was facility to give rating above &quot;excellent&quot; we would give it.
4	 Very friendly staff, tasty food and great views across Paignton harbour. We really liked this restaurant and would decimating go back. 
4	 We went with friends for what should have been breakfast, as we heard amazing things about it, but ended up as a impromptu lunch due to our inability to get anywhere on time.  The staff were welcoming, engaging and entertaining. We were laughing before we'd even ordered drinks. They were patient as we had to wait quite a while for the fourth member of our group to join us.   The service was outstanding and the food was amazing. Good comforting food on a cold day.  We will definitely be visiting again, hopefully to try the breakfasts next time, though we won't be disappointed with another lunch.   Highly Recommended!!!! 
4	 Well what can I say, fabulous food, fantastic atmosphere, and Barbara makes you feel special, what a welcome, all the food our party ate was top notch. Well done keep it up Maidstone needs more eateries like this one. The hard work certainly pays off here. 
4	 We visited this place on a windy Saturday evening, and it became one of the most joyful moments while we traversed Sheffield.  It was quite cold outside, and the indoor temperature was well-conditioned with music volume properly monitored --- FIRST GREAT IMPRESSION.  Before we ordered, the waitress explained all the things we asked about CLEARLY AND PATIENTLY, to make sure that we could get exactly what we wanted for dinner. Plus, the menu is extensive, and all of the dishes we ordered were really delicious, reminding us of the taste of homemade food in East Asia, including vegetable soup, sweet and sour pork, seafood tofu hot-pot, just to name a few. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and we believe Tokyou will be a nice choice if student associations are looking for a place to arrange a small private party or meetup someday.   We really enjoyed dining in this place. Will definitely come to this restaurant again! Thank you Tokyou! 
4	 An excellent range of draught products only bettered by the fact the cask ales are brewed on site.  Trendy decor in comfortable surroundings and a fantastic beer garden as well. I didn't eat but plenty were and it looked great, so I will be back! 
4	 We went back here after a year or so and found the staff even more friendly and welcoming. The food is excellent with lots of variety. Fantastic value - we will be back! 
4	 We go to this place pretty frequently and the latest visit was just the wife and I. We started with some olives, which were great as always. I the smoked salmon starter which is great and a good size portion. I followed this with a carbonara, again great. Staff were fantastic as always, served again byvthe great South African chap. Normally we enjoy the house Trebianno, but we were on a dry January so stuck to the water. We've subsequently fell off the dry wagon so will be back soon and will be having wine!!!!! 
4	 This was my second visit to the Dining Room and I found the food and the service to be excellent. The students had created a great atmosphere with soft Italian music in the background, candles on the tables, an Italian designed menu which looked very professional. There was even an Italian themed presentation playing on the TV screens to provide a backdrop. The food was great quality and value with three courses for £15 which included a Belini cocktail served on arrival. Overall staff were very confident and friendly. I'll be watching the website for the next list of themed nights and special events. Look forward to returning! 
4	 Been here with friends and then my family. Lovely fresh food and brilliant service from cracking staff. Value for money is excellent. Would definitely recommend to friends and families. 
4	 The thought of having the best crab sandwich in UK - all white meat and a great cup of tea keeps me coming back! Perfect if busy spot by the harbour. 
4	The atmosphere already from outside is Amazing. Very well decorated inside and outside. I booked my table a couple of days before for me and my girlfriend. Our table was in one of the boxes upstairs. On Sunday at lunchtime and dinnertime you can also enjoy the String quartet and Opera singers while you are having your meal. Food is absolutely of good quality and and also the Wine list, nice selection. The staff is polite and careful to details.
4	 Booked a table for a team social last Friday. We were attracted by the excellent reviews already given to this little gem and it didn't dissapoint a bit. I had to go again just the day after (Saturday), this time with my fiancée and a couple of dear friends. We ddidnt book a table, just turned up and they do every effort to not only accommodate us but make us feel super welcome. On our first gist, my colleagues weren't too conversant on North African food so we went for the safety of set menus and the £33.00 per head was a wonder. The best tagines surrounded by plenty of starters and a great Moroccan wine. On our second visit we explored a la crate and it was even better. Ant then the very attentive staff was there to cater for every need. Thank you 
4	 This was our 3rd visit & once again, what a great night out, one of our friends is a vegetarian & she was catered for really well, by the staff. The food & atmosphere was very good & we will defiantly be returning again. 
4	 Very modern light modern wood furnishings , not like most conventional Indian restaurants .Service & food very good. Thoroughly enjoyable experience. 
4	 Tremendous value and friendly welcome. Having just tried to go into Ed's Diner near the Intu Centre and having been turned away at 8.20am as we were too early for breakfast, we made the shortish walk to this Wetherspoons restaurant. What a difference, a friendly welcome, help with settling our 2 year old grandson into a high chair and a superbly cooked full breakfast with unlimited good coffee. Although not in the shopping complex, for value and welcome it is well worth making the short walk to get a fantastic value breakfast. 
4	 Currently sat in Whites enjoying my Sunday afternoon. Just inhaled a Chicken Fajita Burger which was delicious and came with fries and garlic mayo. YUM! I washed it down with a tasty smoothie! I'm going to sit here for an hour or two more and continue doing my work. Perfect place to sit, plan and people watch! 
4	This restaurant specialises in fish and the fish is always fresh. Daily deliveries from Lowestoft ensure that the quality is always of a high standard. We would not hesitate to reccomend to anyone who enjoys a good selection that is well prepared. The restaurant is owned and run by Abby and Nigel. Abby is the excellent chef and Nigel is Mine Host.
4	 A very friendly atmosphere, great service, personable and leisurely. An inspirational idea for a community coffee shop, just what was needed in the village. This young man will go far. Thank you Sam. 
4	What a lovely surprise when we walked in, spotlessly clean and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. It's like walking into your on home. Great choice of drinks, the house red is lovely. We had starter main and pudding food was top quality beautifully presented and warm, I had bread and butter pudding for desert I thought I'd died and gone to heaven amazing! Thank you Dodford in for a lovely evening we will be back.
4	 I actually enjoyed the cocktail selection just as much as the food very relaxing scene! all the dishes come with a great presentation and excellent staffs suggesting all the best from the menu. Will be coming here more often 
4	 We're a household of Leeds and Blues supporters, so breaking bread at the Villa isn't exactly a natural instinct. However, for this one Sunday we put our prejudices to one side and booked in for Sunday Lunch on enemy territory at restaurant VMF and it was... great! The food was locally sourced, veg from their own allotment around the corner, very well cooked and excellently presented. There was a good choice and we all went for something different - starters tasty and reasonably substantial. The mains were the stand out - the lamb, beef and pork were superbly prepared - each cooked exactly as we requested, subtly seasoned and surrounded by a tasty and equally well prepared variety of veg. Desserts were fab, too. What made our day, however, were the staff - young, engaged, really proud of their restaurant and desperate to do a good job. It's a training restaurant, so a good cause to boot... just a shame about all that Villa stuff all over the shop. 
4	The Thai Gold Bistro of Tiverton have always provided excellent Thai food but now include All Day &quot;English&quot; breakfast., Elevenses featuring locally made cakes from Jenny's Farmhouse Cakes from Rackenford
4	 Family run for a good while, great food & excellent hosts. Would go regular, if it was closer. Will definitely put it down as a stop off place when heading West! Go it's Great. @NewAdvice 
4	 Have been here for takeaways for s long time and can never fault the service or the food! The quality is excellent the taste is amazing and the service has always been fab and pleasant.  The options in the menu for both eat in and takeaway are perfect and you're able to order online as well now!!  We moved further away recently but would still rather travel here than our more local Indians!          
4	 What can i say, i have just experienced a taste of heaven in a cup, not only served with a smile but a very good value to i can see this will be my regular stop off point in the most welcome surroundings. I also had some of their home made cake, well worth the walk after to make way for my next visit to this well run family deli. Best in the area by far! 
4	 I went on Christmas eve to Prashad and enjoyed a lovely meal served quickly. Nothing was too much trouble: we had an extra mouth to feed and they fitted us all in even though there wasn't room.   The food was well prepared, tasty, spicy, colourful, well presented, and an all round feast. We didn't order a dessert as with very little food we were full, however a complimentary one was offered.   I am looking forward to my next visit there! 
4	 Having lived around the world including Japan and California (two Sushi loving places) I found it hard to get truely good sushi in London. I can say hands down the sushi is absolutely fantastic and the best I've had in London. The theme in the bars/restaurants along with the views over London are spectacular. A special mention for the floorstaff and the floor manager Oto who was top class and made it his business to introduce himself and make sure everything you wanted was catered for. Overall 5* 
4	 Fantastic food,best risotto I ever tasted. One of the cleanest restaurants I had visited . If you are in diss and love Italian food well worth a visit. 
4	Took my girlfriend there for a birthday meal after the races. Service was exceptional and the waitresses were all friendly and went out of their way to help.   Had the bruschetta to start which was delicious, and for main I had the pistachio crusted lamb rump (see picture). Beautifully presented and tasted great. I was sat in sight of the kitchen and was fascinating to see the effort the chefs made with the presentation of the meals. Not usually that bothered about presentation but it really made the meal for me and my girlfriend.   Highly recommend visiting.
4	 Whilst spending a week on Norfolk we were struggling to find something better than your average Pub Grub, until we found &quot;Relish&quot;. The food was beautiful, wine recommends great, all complimented by friendly and attentive staff. Rachel and Jeremy have worked hard here to deliver a high quality experience in relaxed surroundings. We enjoyed our first visit on a Tuesday that much that we went back again on the Friday evening to have the perfect end to a chilling out week in Norfolk. Hopefully we'll get the chance to visit again one day. 
4	Love coming to O&E it is a great experience and the food is great. Service as always is outstanding and kids are always welcome and on request dishes can be adapted for little ones palettes. Looking forward to returning.
4	 We were celebrating a birthday and were treated to a meal at the Hutong. We had the taster menu and enjoyed everything on it . We also had different Chinese cocktails and rice wine with every course . At the end of the meal we had a lovely birthday cake .The view was amazing, the service was excellent and I would recommend it to friends. 
4	 We use the pub mostly at lunch or early evening. It is one of our favourites. Close to the high street, It has an excellent range of beers, and very friendly staff. There is normally good music playing, pool table for customers and TV for sport. Definately a good conversational pub.   The Thai food is exceptionally good, the best we have ever had, and attractively priced. We have stopped using any other Thai restaurants in Slough and Windsor. We accidently ordered the wrong dish last night and it was delicious. I recommend Thai Dumpling, Diamond Tofu, Carrot Curry Ball for the Starters Tom Yam Soup very tasty and spicy as in Thailand and Panang Curry...Brilliant! 
4	 I recently revisited this venu whilst on business in the area and was greatly impressed with the new look following a refurbishment last year. The restaurant are certainly was very high quality finish and the atmosphere was pleasant. I sat in one of the booth areas and found it comfortable and private.  I had an Antipasti of cured meats which was delicious and to follow the Beef Daube which came with some lovely sweet red braised cabbage. The two dishes were produced to a very high standard.  I had a fantastic meal and would highly recommend to anyone thinking of going, I will certainly be going back! 
4	The service, food, atmosphere were simply perfect. It's been a while since I ate a good food. I absolutely recommend every one to try it.
4	 We wanted a special evening to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary with friends!!! We had the option of going anywhere in Leeds but chose Salvo's as they have given us so many great evenings over the years. Having run a business myself, one that ran Service Excellence training for major companies, I am aware how difficult it is to maintain excellence and stay 'the tops' over the long term. Salvo's have mastered the art! The food (main courses Tria of Fish, Belly Pork, poached plaice, vegetable gratin) was outstanding. The Service was excellent - warm, welcoming and professional.Over 35 years we have seen the place stay ahead of the competition and on this occasion again they made our evening very memorable. They please so many customers and are so good at making them all feel special! Many thanks to the Salvo's team! 
4	 If you only out once this year make it this pub ! book early because it fills up quick for good reason....the food is amazing and the service is fantastic.............did I mention the food is AMAZING ? 
4	 A gem on Whiteladies Rd! I recently went to Nomu for a cocktail with a group of friends as we’d heard good things about the place, and we were very pleased. The staff are very friendly and clearly know their cocktails, I basically wanted an alcoholic drink which was mint, creamy, chocolaty – the perfect drink came, it was delicious! Four cocktails later, each one better than the last, we ended up staying much longer than planned – I want to tell more people about this place. They’ve clearly not been open long so still finding their feet but give it a go, you won’t be disappointed!  Oh yes, and the food is tasty and great value – didn’t want a full meal so the small eats were perfect for me (£13 for 3)!  Will definitely visit again 
4	 Excellent food and service. Book early, they close the door at 21:00hrs. Parking at a premium, but look around, 
4	 On the recommendation of our hotel, we tried Na Lampang just opposite Kingsholm Rugby stadium.   What a great find! Truly amazing Thai food that was absolutely delicious, all were delightful and was a lovely atmosphere. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great Thai Food experience. Intimate and authentic dining. We had Mixed Platter, Temple Platter and we tried Lamb Massaman, Spicy Sizzling Seafood dish, wonderful Green Chicken Curry, ultimate Fire Rice and Chicken Pad Thai for a great price with wonderful service. This place has become in the top of the top on our list for good restaurant.  Please don't be turn down by the size of this place you will be very surprised.  Na Lampang is really a gem in Gloucester. We highly recommend it. 
4	 I absolutely love the chain of Koh Thai/Koh Noi restaurants and attended each of them regularly (Christchurch, Bournemouth & Liliput). As always the food is spectacular, the cocktails are to die for, the atmosphere is wonderful and the service is always great. I will remain a regular customer at all Koh branches :) 
4	 Popped in for a cuppa and snack before heading home after a walk - but went for the mulled wine and a mince pie. Best mince pie I've ever had, great mincemeat, well-filled and excellent pastry - don't think I've ever raved about a mince pie before! 
4	I very much enjoyed my visit to this local Eco restaurant/cafe. They serve homemade cakes and other sweet treats, all of which are baked to 'fulfilling goodness'.   They offer gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options, which all seem to match their meaty counterparts in taste.   Service was friendly and genuine while remaining fast and thorough.   Don't expect fine dining or a greasy fry up but do expect lovely English 'just like your mum used to make' hearty dishes.
4	 After reading many reviews and a few short snips of All Star lanes on Made In Chelsea i thought it was time to entertain some clients and colleagues.  Overall we had an excellent experience at the venue with excellent customer service from the staff at the main reception and over the phone. I have noted some benefits/perils of the venue to give better insight on what to expect on your trip.  Positives  -Excellent location near Holborn which is literally round the corner from Soho/West end -Customer service was brilliant went accommodating a large party(12 people) -Intimate setting and as we had two lanes it felt like our own private function -Clean venue, great lanes, great support and overall atmosphere was outstanding  Negatives  -A few negatives starting with as the venue is very small availability is very scarce so book well in advance -You have to eat in order to bowl at peak times... on Friday some people just want to get drunk -The price of bowling doubles as you have to dine in the venue  Apart from that it is an outstanding venue for personal/business events and both myself and the team had a wonderful time!!  Best bowling lanes ever!  
4	 Me and 5 friends visited teppanyaki chinatown on our lunch on a wowcher deal. Couldn't fault it, great food, service and atmosphere! Will be returning! 
4	 Popped in one evening before opening time (were let in to sit and wait), had a great couple of beers and a wonderful fish and chips. Good price, great food. 
4	 Went looking for a place that did a large variety of curries with different meats and vegetables in order for everyone in a table of 15 to get something they wanted. Barton Rouge delivered. Took me personally nearly 15 minutes to decide what I wanted from there as the selection was that good. Service and drinks were also great and were very attentive to our large party. Craving it again already. 
4	I went with wife and brother and we all chose to eat differently with only one having the &quot;flaming wok&quot; experience. Buffet food was excellent and good value compared with local competition. Three courses for £9.80, less with web coupon and at £3.40 the cheapest beer in Trumpington - John Smiths.Better choice of sweet than previously - a particular favourite were the sugar coated cashews with the soft self serve ice cream and fruit etc. Difficult not to over indulge but will go again in a week or two.
4	 I have visited this place a couple of times as my girlfriend recently moved to the area. I expected it to be very basic, with its cheap prices and its Wetherspoons like menu, however this place far exceeded my expectations.  Friendly staff, a great choice of drinks and the food was really nice. A great space outside to sit in the sun and a comfortable and friendly atmosphere inside. The prices are very competitive but the food is lovely and the portions generous. This is not fine dining, but a really lovely pub for food and drink whether with friends or family. 
4	 We visited on a Tuesday night, arriving at just before seven. They were very busy, but sat us at the bar with some complimentary nuts while we waited for our table. So we ordered a beer, some fresh bread with garlic mayonnaise, and within a few minutes we were seated. The sevice was slick and efficient, despite the waiter saying the chef was a bit slow, the food all came out quickly and was very well cooked and presented. The aubergine chips are great, with a slightly sweet flavour, soft and crispy in the same mouthful. The fried cheese with tomato jam was really good, the meatballs and very spacey grilled chorizo hit the spot. Go easy on what you order, the dishes are generous and you may be full quickly. Afterall, you can always order some more dishes if you are still hungry. A big thumbs up to the restaurant manager for keeping it running so smoothly on an exceptionally busy night. Very good food, served quickly and with very good attitude, an excellent night. If you like tapas, then try Uno, their really good 
4	 We normally eat at The Big Wok, but it is closed for refurbishment, so Ming Moon was second choice. The restaurant was fairly busy but we were seated straight away. plenty of choices of food with a big selection of Indian/Asian dishes to choose from as well. All the food was hot and regular supplies being replenished as and when needed. Everywhere was very clean and the staff were keen to remove empty plates as you finished. Nice guy doing live music on an electric Guitar/Violin, which was nice, and the drinks are reasonably priced as well. Would recommend. 
4	 this coffee shop makes excellent use of godstall lane, Chesters heritage, 1000 years old. its like a trip to somewhere lovely in europe, saddened to leave one can return any time with many welcomes. 
4	Visited 11/11/13 at 5pm.Being a Monday I thought it may be quiet and it was .We were greeted on arrival by staff and the manager. We were on a deal for 2 at 15 pounds sterling. We had a cocktail each and ordered stir fry duck each and a portion each of coconut rice and egg fried rice.The meal was fantastic .The flavours were incredible. After we had eaten the manager said he was about to have his dinner and then brought us a couple of sample portions. Pumpkin in thai sauce and fried egg in tamarind sauce. Again the flavours were excellent. The hospitality was a thing we have not observed for years .Highly recommended.
4	Although I have lived in the area for 35 years, I have never eaten at this pub before last week.  I visited with my wife after hearing rave reviews as well as learning of the recent awards they have received. Often places like this which have been built up to be something special are a bit of a let-down. The Phoenix wasn't.   The choice on the menu was superb - one of those places where it takes ages to choose as so many of the dishes sound appealing. Once we eventually did choose, everything we ordered was excellent. We literally could not fault it (and we do like to whinge if things are not quite right!).  During the meal the chef came round to all the tables and asked if we were enjoying the food - and he genuinely seemed to care; a nice touch.  The décor was very pleasant - tables nicely spaced out and a good rustic ambience.  I have also been to the pub several times just for a beer - the bar is totally separate to the restaurant and is also very pleasant. Good choice of ales and wines, lovely open fire, comfortable chairs and a nice atmosphere.  I will be back. Sooner rather than later I suspect.
4	 My girlfriend and re-visited the restaurant last week as an early birthday meal for myself. It's a great place for special occasions as the food is great, it is reasonably priced and there always seems to be a relaxed atmosphere. We went on a Tuesday night on this occasion and the restaurant was still fairly full. We had 3 courses, each one delicious! Will definitely be hoping to visit again for our next special occasion! 
4	 I don't often put pen to paper(key to iPad!) but,I truly had the most amazing dining experience at this restaurant....The food was divine:beautifully presented,tasted fantastic,and because we chose the menu option of being surprised with wine chosen by our sommelier -we had a perfect dining experience .....I am in the hospitality industry myself(Senior cabin crew member for a leading UK Airline ) and , I have to compliment two of the staff(maitre D and sommelier :Liam and Julien-I hope I have your names correct?)their service was OUTSTANDING!...The attention to detail,the presentation and knowledge of wine and food combinations,and the general demeanour /charm were &quot;spot on &quot;!!!!!This was my partner'as 40th birthday treat...These two gentlemen made it unique without knowing it!...I would not hesitate in hiring them as Cabin Crew if I had the chance:ambassadors for excellence in customer service!.....THANK YOU 
4	Working in a kitchen myself, I feel I have high standards from other restaurants, however 'The Hythe Brasserie' did not disappoint. This is in regards to staff, presentation and the taste of the food itself. On arrival, we were pleasantly greeted and attended to quickly. The food was beautiful.. I had the soup and cod, chips and minty peas. Both were well presented and tasted lovely as were my parents food also. We all left full up and very happy! I would highly recommend and would return in a heartbeat!
4	 Friendly, tasteful and comfortable atmosphere. Imaginative menu and delicious food prepared to order. Kind and and helpful staff. On the night I visited service was a little slow but this was due entirely to the unexpected arrival of several large groups at the same time. The situation was handled brilliantly by the most charming manageress, who despite the pressure remained friendly, unflustered and made sure everyone was well looked after. Well done! 
4	Fantastic food, great service. Went for the sparkling wine and seafood tasting menu. Wonderful combinations, enough to eat without feeling stuffed for both myself and my wife. Great explanation of why a particular sparkling wine goes with each course. Recommended.
4	 The best lamb balti I have ever had! Lovey restaurant and very friendly staff. Would highly recommend Bengal Palace for a reasonably priced curry. 
4	 This is a fantastic restaurant and a 'got to try'. very cheap and great value for money. i will defo be returning. thanks 
4	 recently went to the ferry house it was fantastic my family and i loved your food and me and my brother loved the chips they were great xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
4	 Have bin to your restaurant alot of times and really love the food and the staff are all so helpful i have told all my friends if they are looking for a good place to go and eat please go to Piccolino :) 
4	 4 of us went to this pub yesterday, wonderful welcome, nothing too much trouble for staff, service very quick, good choice of meals, plenty of options for vegetarians which in a lot of places now you'll find only one. The portions are huge, and the price at the end was more than reasonable, We intend to spread the word amongst our circle of friends. Well done. 
4	Comfortable and roomy restaurant, good atmosphere, excellent food and service. Previously up the road in St Peter's Street but now in a much more pleasant Victorian building, carefully and interestingly decorated. Service was attentive but not stifling. Interesting menu - usual favourites but many interesting dishes. Our starters were subtly scented bhajis,; also a very generous and tasty plate of whitebate. I particularly enjoyed my chicken Tawa dish. Several families with young (well behaved) children were enjoying a family outing, as we were with our adult children. 10% service added.
4	 Fantastic place, great food ( dont eat beforehand!) great atmosphere, lovely welcome. A diamond on the banks of the thames. Recommend eating here. 
4	 I went as part of a large party and we were personally greeted by the owner Arshad. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I had a chicken karahi which was excellent. The restaurant was busy, the atmosphere good. 
4	They keep things simple here.  I ordered a cheese burger (good choice of cheeses to select from) and french fries.  They recommend to order the burgers medium and I'd listen - they know best and have developed a nice formula.  They have probably worked long and hard at the shabby exposed brick, exposed light bulbs, bare floor boards and basic mis-matched chairs and tables look. It works. The focus should all point at the simple goodness of the food. Burger (juicy) came with the cheese, simple tomato, lettuce, red onion and mayo - and takes top marks. No need for many words the flavour spoke volumes.  Find this place at the foot of Upper Street, close to Angel tube. People inside look happy and satisfied (they persuaded me to go in and they should you).
4	The restaurant is conveniently located slap bang in the middle of Wilmslow Road in Didsbury. It looks very inviting from the outside.  Upon entering the restaurant, you're welcomed by a very smart well put together restaurant and a very attentive staff.  The food was fantastic, the courses didn't come out too slowly or too quickly, it was all just right.  A very nice dining experience that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.
4	 We had our pre-Christmas meal here. We enjoyed the cocktails at our table in a quiet corner of the restaurant. We ate from the Christmas menu, which was delicious. The service was excellent, all the staff are very friendly making the meal that bit more special. We have eaten here a few times now and have had a great meal on every occasion. 
4	 We've had a handful of meals at Zayka since the restaurant opened. On every visit we have enjoyed the ambience and whether they've been busy or quiet, the service has been very good with nice personal touches. The menu is extensive and all the dishes we have tried have been some of the best Indian food we've eaten. It's not a cheap visit but it's worth the money, especially as a treat ! 
4	 Looking for some tea-time refreshment, we were attracted by this café’s slogan saying they don’t serve fast food – they serve real food as fast as they can. A good maxim – and, fortunately, one that is fully justified in this case. Liquid tea appeared almost at once and after a short while was followed by a very generous double plate of food – all for £14.50 for two. The orange drizzle-cake was on the dry side, and another time we’d make a different choice: there were other very interesting looking cakes on display, but we ordered in some haste. However, the scones were excellent, and the well-filled sandwiches had obviously been made to order. We were sufficiently impressed as to decide there and then that we’d be returning for breakfast the next morning. A large and very tasty omelette had been particularly well cooked: it wasn’t served at all wet (wisely, at that wouldn’t be to many people’s taste for a breakfast dish) but it was remarkably fluffy – most enjoyable, and very filling. We couldn’t resist the toasted tea-cakes. Both were accompanied by spectacularly good coffee (and I admit to being very fussy about coffee). It was a breakfast worthy of the very best hotels – and far superior to all the ordinary ones. 
4	 Was so so surprised To have such a nice meal locally  The food was brilliant  The service attention to detail & the lamb chops were amazing  Would recommend 
4	 Although we have visited the Royal Albert Hall on numerous occasions, this was our first time eating at the restaurant. Not knowing what to expect, we were therefore delighted by the excellent service and friendly staff. The atmosphere was relaxed and a perfect start to the afternoon's main event. Our waitress, Emanuela, was attentive yet not intrusive. The seared stone bass was cooked to perfection, in fact, all three courses could not have been better. We have already rebooked for another concert and meal later this year. 
4	 Great service and even better food! Worth the trip down from Plymouth! Looking forward to the next visit! 
4	 We have been eating here regularly for the past year usually as a couple and sometimes as a party of up to eight. The meals are very well cooked great homemade chips generous portions and great value. The beer is kept very well and there is a good selection. Overall the pub has a good atmosphere and is busy in the evenings. 
4	 Really nice place, food is great. All dishes bought were tasty (apart from one lamb main where the meat was a bit tough) Really good service and we were allowed to bring a bottle of our own wine! 
4	 I've been to Wright Brothers in Borough a couple of times now and thought it about time I share. I've been for an informal business lunch and with friends in the evening. The options on local (Southern England) fresh fish and Oysters have been impressive, it's great to see a place celebrating these home-grown treats! The whole roasted Dover Sole was amazing. As you'd expect there's a good selection of craft beers and mineral-led white whites. The atmosphere and service complete the picture ... who doesn't like a stroll through back in time through the small streets of borough and the famous market? Friendly, sincere service. Highly recommend, particularly if you're hosting people in London. 
4	 Went to The Foundry on Saturday night with friends - a great night. The place was full to the rafters with a great atmosphere. The food, wine and service were first class. The Cote de Boeuf for 2 people is fantastic. As good a restaurant as there is in Leeds. 
4	 My wife and myself have eaten here three or four times over the past twelve months and every time we have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and choice of the food. This is probably our favorite restaurant in Worcester. We also like Thai, mexicam etc but if we want a good Bistro style menu we always go here. The staff are all friendly and welcoming and make the overall experience top class. 
4	Excellent evening meal. I had the soup and steak, my wife the lasagne.  All the staff were relaxed and friendly.
4	 We visited St Ives on our honeymoon and wanted a nice meal before leaving, we couldn't have done better than the hidden kitchen. The food is incredible, as we understood it changes weekly depending on what's in season or what the chef has found. Gives it a very authentic feel and an appreciation of the local ingredients. The blackberry mousse in particular was incredible, definitely one to choose if they're serving it.   Hugely recommend this, we went as a couple and it seemed everyone else there was too, but it seems like it would work well for big groups too. 
4	 For those who appreciate Southern Indian vegetarian cuisine Coconut Lagoon is a great place. When I go there with my wife we are very predictable. We always end up having a Vadai for starter and a Masala Dhosa for a main. Excellent every time. 
4	 Had a lovely evening at this restaurant on Sat 19th October. Food was excellent, really fresh and also it was very good value . Would highly recommend this place to anyone 
4	You'll find me there most Sundays, at our favourite haunt for lunch. Excellent food, service, atmosphere, good beer, nice range of whiskys as well, make sure you book!
4	 Lovely décor, excellent cooking, good wines, superb, friendly but not obtrusive service. What more do you want? Would recommend to anyone. 
4	 Great service for a group of 10. Individuals within the group had an issue about paying a (12.5%) service charge however the staff dealt with it so well that I paid back the refunded service charge in tips to those involved. Fantastic service 
4	 So I decided to try out the Eight Bells after my friends recently visited, saying how good it was. I was a little weary as I'd been to the other local pubs and wasn't too impressed at all with the food.  I was a little embarrassed about how sceptical I was about my friends review. I was not let down at all. The food was amazing. Such nice country style food, brilliantly done. With extremely friendly and helpful staff.  
4	 We recently visited Buffet City for the second time . It as a fantastic range of Chinese and Indian food . There is a large buffet choice with starters mains and desserts . There is also live cooking . Depending on what day and what time the price varies so do check the prices which are FROM £XXX .Also be careful not to leave too much on your plate they are srict about this and charge a penalty !!!! Overall very good value . Good service mostly Romanian nice surroundings . 
4	 Everything about the visit was amazing, Food was great, drinks were well made. Staff were fantastic. You've done it again, be proud! 
4	 Have visited on two occasions leading up to Christmas and both time was fed and entertained to an excellent standard. 
4	 This is a lovely little tea room with a warm and cosy atmosphere, very friendly staff and home made food.   After offering us free parking to walk to up to the lighthouse and across the cliffs, we decided to stop on the way back for lunch.  The food was fresh, tasty, filling and cooked to order... What more can you ask for? 
4	 We been in Gurkha's Pride yesterday with friends. The restaurant was already full but we were already secured seats by online. It was first visit but the food was super that we never had else where before. Will not forget amazing serve by smiling Nepalese staffs. They are very professional for hospitality job. We will back soon. 
4	 wondeful place: food extraordinary! I had a dinner with my friends and all was perfect! Delicious Parma ham and burrata and spaghetti meatballs, and the best is tiramisu! the italian staff is the best! 
4	 Excellent and good value Sunday lunch and huge evening meals . Good attentive service . Lovely tasty meat . Great atmosphere. Also love evening with singers Sunday and Thursday. 
4	 Went for a nice morning breakfast at this café , the breakfast was excellent and well-priced. The café is in a central location in the town centre. The café is clean, modern and a friendly environment.I Would definitely go back for breakfast or to have something from the lunch menu on my next return to Preston 
4	 Been a few times now and every time we've had a great meal out. Food is fantastic value for what you're getting, for a chain pub the quality of food and drinks is really great. The staff are brilliant too, always really helpful. We love the atmosphere here and love how friendly all the staff are, in particular the managers Gina, Hev and Chad, that we've started to make the Blue Bowl our new regular go-to place! 
4	 I first eat at the Kash as a 19 year old in 1970, in the days when there wasn't even a menu. In 45 years the food has always been excellent and the meat bhuna that I always have is just as good now as it was then, as are the chapatis, (I've never once had rice). The only thing that has changed is that the papdums aren't as fresh as they once were, but then whose are. The days of hot fat smeared papdums seem to be over. My last visit, 28/06/2015, 4 papdums, one shared mixed started (you have to try this), one prawn masala, one meat bhuna (not on the menu so ask for it) for £16. Please don't change the Kash, it's perfect as it is. Great food, cafe service and outstanding value. 
4	This is an informal dining experience with all the staff, without exception, being friendly and caring. The food is absolutely fantastic, created by a lovely chef. This is not one of the cheapest restaurants but, for a special occasion, it is certainly worth every penny.
4	Stumbled across this little gem very nice and warm inside. Great menu loads and loads of dishes reasonably priced absolutely wonderful food and lovely spices Service was excellent. Waiters very friendly great place Worth a visit.
4	We have lived in Beckenham for the past 10 years and had many a great night out at Q-bar, which among the locals has been well regarded as the best restaurant in town. If your in the area, i would highly recommend it.
4	 We would like to THANK the Bull Inn Team for the outstanding service.  First of all, Kim, the manager, decorated both the function room and gazebo beautifully. She helped with the choice of food, drinks and timings. Also, she willingly looked for and recommended some local services, such as an highly-talented florist, table hire etc.  Secondly, the whole team were in total control of the smooth running of our special day. All our guests were impressed with the food and the friendly service. Nothing was too much trouble for the team and they helped make our day perfect .  We have been eating out for many years, around the UK and would give the Bull Inn top rating. The presentation was stunning and elegant and the taste was exceptional.  Thirdly, the breathtaking views, beautiful garden and decking area made the place unforgettable for us and our guests, who enjoyed having drinks outside.  Our only complaint is that the SUPERB evening flew by far too quickly. 
4	 I was in Oxford with my wife and son and came upon this place by accident. My son and I had an assortment of startere and would say that the Chicken Wings and the Calamari were both superb. The place was that good we returned for lunch the next day. 
4	 Called in last Sunday to find a friendly (they even allowed our dogs in) atmosphere with a roaring log fire and attentive friendly staff. The food was very well presented and tasted as good as it looked. The day did not allow us to take advantage of the extensive grounds, but in spring or summer we would have done. First class in every way. 
4	 From the moment you walk in you're made to feel very welcome.  The staff are amazingly helpful and very well informed about the menu which doesn't disappoint at all. The food was exquisite, perfectly cooked and very well presented. The atmosphere is perfect for couples on dates or family meals with loved ones. The sticky toffee pudding I would travel around the world for its just amazing can't wait to go back so we have already booked our return visit. The food is amazing for the cost and as it says on the menu &quot;First class London dinning in bexleyheath&quot;.  Just brilliant all round service and food. 
4	 Went here last weekend (14th Sep 2012) and had a really great and very very reasonably priced meal. Before the meal we were given our wooden spoon with a table number on it and waited downstairs in Maya where we had Pineapple (and other...including pomegranate) margaritas- which were really really delicious. I'm sure the just come from a slushie machine and have pineapple syrup added but it was the nicest drink I've had in a long long time. The bar downstairs had a cool vibe, nice lighting, really friendly staff and a good drinks menu especially if you love tequila...  I digress...for main I had the ribs with the red rice and it was delicious! When it came out I thought &quot;oh no, I'll never eat all that&quot;- but I did! I ate with friends who had the chilli and a steak burrito. The chilli came with rice, salsa and really delicious plantain crisps. My two friends also had the chilli fries which were really spicy and tasty, I had a great time here. The staff were attentive, the food was great and the price was very very competitive.   I'd recommend it and I'd love to go back! 
4	 Stopped quickly for lunch travelling from Herts to Sussex. We rang in advance due to having a dog with us.  It was dog friendly and the menu was good. I had Croque Monsieur and my wife had Fish Goujon sandwich. Both came with French Fries and salad garnish.   The staff were very friendly, the local beer was good (Daisy Gold from Brightwater Brewery), and my wife's wine was very good (Bishop's Leap NZ Sauvignon Blanc).  The pub had a nice traditional feel with a roaring real fire. There was a good quality high chair for my daughter.  Everything was perfect and we were impressed with the full menu. Unfortunately we don't live nearby so can't be sure to return for a full meal though we'd definitely like to.  We did watch some nearby tables have the full meals. They looked lovely and we're recommended by the people who ordered them.
